description: Joe Biden’s energy plan calls for outlawing reliable fossil fuel
  electricity and mandating unreliable solar and wind electricity. This will not
  stop CO2 emissions from rising but it will destroy American industry,
  impoverish American consumers, and jeopardize American security.

### Quick summary

1. Energy schemes around the world based on “unreliables”—solar and wind—have been driving up electricity costs, harming economies, destroying domestic industries, and harming consumers. Germans pay 3X US electricity prices to get just 1/3 of their electricity from solar and wind.[^1]
2. Instead of learning from the failures of unreliable energy schemes, the Biden Plan seeks to do far worse by outlawing reliable fossil fuel electricity and forcing Americans to pay $2 trillion--$7,500 a household--for a solar and wind-based grid that can’t possibly work.[^2]
3. Joe Biden says that forcing Americans to rely on unreliable solar and wind will create jobs. But making electricity unreliable and unaffordable doesn’t create jobs, it destroys them. Just ask the UK aluminum industry, which “green energy” schemes are driving out of business.[^3]
4. Joe Biden says that forcing Americans to rely on unreliable solar and wind will help middle-class Americans. But the cost of energy affects the cost of everything. Skyrocketing energy costs will drive skyrocketing food, housing, healthcare, and transportation costs.
5. America is already too reliant on unreliable solar and wind. That’s why utilities are already blacking out many of their industrial customers. And grids in Texas and the Northeast are warning of blackouts for everyone if policies don’t change. Biden’s Plan will guarantee blackouts.[^4]
6. Joe Biden’s support of a ban on fracking, which is required to produce over 60% of American oil and 75% of American natural gas, would destroy millions of jobs and once again make us dangerously dependent on the Middle East and Russia. Do we want to be at the mercy of the likes of Vladimir Putin?[^5] [^6] [^7] [^8]
7. Joe Biden’s plan to force Americans to use unreliable solar and wind won’t stop global CO2 levels from rising, because China and others won’t be stupid enough to follow suit. The only thing it will bring about is an economic and security crisis in America.9
8. If Joe Biden and other Democrats want to lower global CO2 emissions, they should stop demonizing and criminalizing reliable, non-carbon nuclear energy and lower-carbon natural gas. Instead, the Biden Plan continues the overregulation of nuclear and supports banning natural gas.

    In Texas, the grid’s reserve margin—the amount of capacity it has above expected peak demand—has shrunk so much that the Public Utilities Commission of Texas called the situation “very scary.” -[Utility Drive, January 22, 2019](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/texas-regulators-direct-higher-plant-payments-amid-capacity-crunch-concerns-1/546540/) For example, a 2019 story concerning Texas notes, “As wind power slowed, ERCOT instituted its first level of emergency alerts, calling on small industrial and commercial generators to pour power onto the grid, and requesting power from Mexico from which an additional 60 MW were imported on Aug. 15. Installed capacity numbers for electricity from intermittent sources such as wind and solar mean very little when they fail to produce as wind did in the middle of the hot Texas summer.” -[Power Magazine, September 19, 2019](https://www.powermag.com/texas-impending-reliability-issues-with-wind-power/)

    In the U.S. northeast, grid operator ISO-NE warned, the grid is likely to be at risk of fuel shortages and rolling blackouts thanks to limited natural gas pipeline capacity. “In the coming years as more oil, coal, and nuclear leave the system, keeping the lights on in New England will become an even more tenuous proposition.” -ISO New England, [2018 Regional Electricity Outlook](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2018/02/2018_reo.pdf).

    In a [Democratic primary debate in March 2020](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/joe-biden-says-no-new-fracking-for-oil-and-gas) Joe Biden agreed to a radical “no new fracking” policy to attract Democratic voters. While most of the US unconventional oil and gas operations take place on private lands, even a federal policy banning new development would be a substantial hit on domestic energy production.

    Joe Biden’s [energy plan](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) also calls for a net-zero CO2 emissions economy wide by no later than 2050. His [climate plan](https://joebiden.com/climate/) also promises aggressive new methane emission limits. Effectively, this amounts to a ban and early retirement of coal, gas, and oil for electricity generation ([over 60%](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) of the current total), as there is no cost-effective technology available to capture CO2 from fuel combustion, even though Biden tried to [backpedal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2020/07/11/joe-biden-tries-to-clean-up-his-fracking-problem-in-pennsylvania/) on the direct attacks against fracking recently.

    China is already the leading emitter of greenhouse gases, at twice the emissions of the US. All reasonable predictions of future emissions anticipate the overwhelming majority of future emissions coming from developing countries that are trying to close the gap in wealth and energy consumption.
