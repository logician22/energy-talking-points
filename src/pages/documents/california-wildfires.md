  is addressing the root cause: “excess fuel load” from bad forest management.
  Focusing on climate change, a minor variable that we have no near-term control
  over, is a craven political ploy."

### Quick summary

1. Gavin Newsom and other California leaders are blaming the dangerous, out-of-control wildfires in CA on climate change. But temperatures have risen 1 degree C in the last 150 years. Is it really possible that that amount of warming makes dangerous wildfires inevitable? No.[^1]
2. With proper forest management we can prevent anything resembling the dangerous, out-of-control wildfires we are experiencing today. And we could do so even if the CA climate were far more fire-prone than it is today. (It has actually been far more fire-prone in the past.)[^2]
3. The key to limiting the danger of wildfires is managing the forest so as to lower the "fuel load"--the amount of dead wood debris that exists in a given area. This can be done by regular "controlled burns" or by manually removing the debris as is often done in logging operations.
4. Terrible forest management is the root cause of today's wildfires. Policymakers have prevented controlled burns, debris clearing, and logging--jacking up the "fuel load" to incredibly dangerous levels. The obvious solution is rational forest management.[^3]
5. Unfortunately, CA policymakers, instead of admitting that the root cause of our wildfire problems is their bad forest management policies--something fully within their control to fix--blame rising CO2 levels, a minor factor that they have no real ability to affect for decades.[^4]
6. Why do I say rising CO2 levels and temps are a minor factor? Because it’s hard to determine any definite influence. Temps are rising slowly, and rising temps tend to cause more precipitation. The influence is certainly tiny compared to irrational forest management.[^5]
7. The negative effect of rising global temperatures on California wildfire susceptibility in particular is dubious because past centuries had far more fire-prone climates. The Palmer Drought Index shows only a slight increase in California drought since 1900.[^6]
8. Historical evidence shows us that prior to man-made CO2 emissions CA experienced regular "megadroughts" that could last over a century. The modern era has been very lush by comparison. Even if CA could lower global CO2 levels we could easily suffer a regional drought.[^7]
9. If CA policymakers want to fix forest management \*and\* slow rising CO2 levels, the only way to do that would be to liberate low-carbon energy innovation, especially in reliable nuclear. Instead, CA policymakers have criminalized nuclear and are shutting down CA's nuclear plants.[^8]
10. CA policymakers' "solution" to rising CO2 levels has been to mandate that we use a lot of unreliable solar and wind, which makes electricity unaffordable and unreliable. This has caused blackouts \*and\* has contributed to wildfires by taking money away from powerline maintenance.[^9]
11. The path forward is simple: focus on the main cause, forest management, which is totally within our control. Stop pretending that lowering CO2 levels would bring about some fire-free paradise--and that it is possible near-term. Stop mandating "unreliables." Decriminalize nuclear.

[^7]: It is difficult to separate any human impact on a particular fire season from the natural noise that the California climate experiences every year. Before the modern records began in the 19th century, California naturally experienced so-called megadroughts that could last over a century. The 20th century has been a very lush period in comparison.\
Climate impacts on California fires are also complex. Dryness leads to more easily ignited vegetation in the short term but less vegetation over time, while more rainfall reduces the short-term risk of fires while creating more biomass for future fires during a dry period. Continued warming will likely increase drought danger in California but also increase precipitation and influence dynamics of the Pacific ocean, which affect California’s climate.

    Any climate impact from human causes that could negatively impact the fires is relatively slow moving compared to the increasing settlement of humans, which causes more fire ignitions from accidents and arsonry and choices of forest management policies. More importantly, any climate policy to slow or reverse such impact, if it was effective at all, would take many decades to make even a small difference.

    The two most important variables in wildfires, ignition by humans and availability of dry vegetation or “fuel load” are under human control.\
