_The Biden administration claims that draining the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve shows its commitment to low gas prices._

_In fact, this is yet another cynical ploy to disguise that its real goal is raise gas prices._[^1]

- **Biden’s claim** that he released 1 billion barrels of gasoline to “lower prices at the pump” **is his latest attempt to convince Americans he's trying to lower gasoline prices. But in fact, he’s doing his utmost to raise prices,** because this is necessary for his anti-fossil-fuel goals.

- **From Day 1, President Biden has openly supported the destruction of the fossil fuel industry,** from his 2019 campaign promise of “I guarantee you, we’re going to end fossil fuel” to his 2021 executive order declaring that America will be “net zero emissions economy-wide” by 2050.[^2]

- **Biden's “net zero” plans require gasoline to be illegal or unaffordably expensive.**

    Illustrating this, EPA set the “social cost of carbon” to $190/ton, which, if implemented as a carbon tax, would make gasoline ~$1.50/gal more expensive. And they plan to significantly increase it by 2050.[^3]

- Given his “net zero” agenda, Biden’s claim to be for low gasoline prices is a vote-grabbing exercise.

    **Biden wants the high gas prices that “net zero” requires—but if voters knew this they would rebel.** Therefore Biden claims to be for both “net zero” and low gas prices.

- **Biden wants to have his “net zero” cake and low gasoline prices too—but ultimately he has to choose one, and so far in his presidency he's chosen “net zero.”**

    Here are 8 actions the Biden administration has taken to increase gasoline prices.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #1**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by taking a “whole-of-government” approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.** This entails reducing oil investment, production, refining, and transport, all of which serves to increase gas prices.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #2**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by expanding the anti-fossil-fuel ESG divestment movement.** ESG contributed to a 50% decline in oil and gas exploration investments from 2011-2021, resulting in artificially higher prices. Biden is making it worse.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #3**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices via “climate disclosure rules,”** an oil and gas investment-slashing measure that coerces companies into spouting anti-fossil-fuel propaganda and committing to anti-fossil-fuel plans—plans that will raise gas prices.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #4**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by issuing a moratorium on oil and gas leases on federal lands, stunting oil and gas production and investment.** When it’s harder to produce and invest in oil, gasoline gets more expensive.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #5**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by hiking the royalty rate for new oil leases by 50%.** This is money the government gets from the industry on top of taxes. And it discourages oil investments, meaning less production meaning higher gas prices.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #6**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by restricting oil and gas leasing on nearly 50% of Alaska's vast petroleum reserve.** This is a crippling blow to Alaska's oil and gas industry. Less Alaskan oil means higher gas prices.[^4]

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #7**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by threatening to stop oil and gas mergers.** Mergers, which increase efficiency, benefit domestic production and lower prices. Blocking mergers raises oil prices long-term, which means higher gas prices.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #8**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline.** This prevented Canada from using its vast oil deposits to their full potential—meaning lower global supply and higher prices for oil and gasoline.

- **When Biden takes action after action to make sure gasoline prices increase for the sake of “net zero” and then loudly claims to be for low prices, he is lying.** But the mainstream media won’t expose him because it too wants to be “net zero” but not seen to be for high gas prices.

- **Politicians who are against oil and gas production, investment, and transport are necessarily for high gasoline prices—and they know it.**

    E.g., when I debated Robert Kennedy Jr. in 2019, he admitted that under his energy plans “the gasoline price at the pump would go up to $12.50”!

- **Joe Biden should level with the American people and make clear that his agenda is to increase gasoline prices**—much like Obama's infamous admission that “electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket” under his energy plan.

- **Better yet, Biden should apologize and embrace energy freedom.**[^5]
