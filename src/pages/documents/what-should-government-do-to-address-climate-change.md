_Q: What should government do to address climate change?_

_A:_ ***“Addressing climate change” is the wrong target;*** _we want to_ ***reduce climate danger.*** _And the proven way to do that is:_ ***let us use all forms of cost-effective energy, including fossil fuels.***

- Asking how government should “address climate change” assumes that us impacting climate must be a bad thing.

    But it’s only bad if it endangers us by creating challenges we can’t master.

    And so far, **our climate mastery has far outpaced any new climate challenges.**

- It’s an irrefutable but little-known fact that **as the world has warmed 1° C, humans have become safer than ever from climate danger.** The rate of climate-related disaster deaths—from storms, floods, temperature extremes, wildfires, and drought—has fallen 98% in the last century.[^1]

- Why has climate safety dramatically increased as climate has become warmer?

    Because any **challenges of warming,** including any other climate changes caused by warming, **have been overwhelmed by our accelerating ability to master climate.** E.g., neutralizing drought via irrigation.

- Why has humanity’s ability to master climate so far outpaced climate challenges? A fundamental cause is **the proliferation of energy, above all from the fossil fuel industry, which powers the machines that enable us to master climate.**

- **Machines,** largely powered by fossil fuels, **have allowed us to:**

    - **master drought danger** via irrigation and crop transport,

    - **master temperature danger** via heating and air conditioning,

    - **master storm danger** via building resilient infrastructure plus storm warning and evacuation systems, etc.

- The fact that fossil fuels have driven unprecedented climate safety means that so far the climate-related benefits of fossil fuels have far overwhelmed any climate-related challenges from fossil fuels.

    Which means that **so far fossil fuels have been a climate hero, not villain.**

- Going forward, any **climate impacts from fossil fuels’ CO2 emissions are only a climate problem if they,** totally contrary to our experience so far, **present challenges that overwhelm the climate mastery benefits of fossil fuels.**
    Mainstream climate science doesn’t show this at all.\

- _Myth:_ Mainstream science shows that rising CO2 is an “existential threat” that will soon cause global catastrophe and then apocalypse.

    _Truth:_ **Mainstream science shows that rising CO2 levels will lead to levels of warming and other changes that we can master and flourish with.**

- _Myth:_ If mainstream science concludes that we will experience more warming, storm intensity, or sea level rises, that means catastrophe or worse.

    _Truth:_ **Given climate mastery, catastrophe could only occur with changes that are a total difference in kind from rising CO2 so far.**

- Climate mastery is so powerful that **for CO2 emissions to be apocalyptic enough to justify rapid fossil fuel restriction or elimination, they'd need to have unprecedented impacts,** such as

    - Seas rising feet per decade

    - 2 times more powerful storms

    Science shows nothing like this.

- _Myth:_ More warming is ominous because heat-related death is already such a huge problem.

    _Truth:_ **Even though Earth has gotten about 1°C warmer, far more people still die from cold than heat** (even in India)! Near-term warming is expected to decrease temperature-related mortality.[^2]

    ![Cold Death](/img/image-1-lancet-more-cold-death-than-heat-death-everywhere.jpg)

- _Myth:_ Future warming is ominous because it will be worst in hot areas.

    _Truth:_ The mainstream view in climate science is that **more warming will be concentrated in colder places** (Northern latitudes) **and at colder times** (nighttime) **and during colder seasons** (winter). Good news.[^3]

    ![Global Temperature Anomalies](/img/global-temperature-anomalies-2000-2009.jpg)

- _Myth:_ Future warming will accelerate as CO2 levels rise.

    _Truth:_ Mainstream science is unanimous that **the “greenhouse effect” is a diminishing effect, with additional CO2 leading to less warming.**

    Even IPCC's most extreme, far-fetched scenarios show warming leveling off.[^4]

    ![Degrees Celsius Warming](/img/image-16-degrees-celsius-warming.jpg)

- _Myth:_ We face catastrophically rapid sea level rises, which will destroy and submerge coastal cities.

    _Truth:_ **Extreme UN sea level rise projections are just 3 feet in 100 years. Future generations can master that.** (We already have 100 million people living below high-tide sea level.)[^5]

    ![Global Mean Sea Level Change](/img/global-mean-sea-level-change-relative-to-1900.jpg)

- _Myth:_ Hurricane intensity is expected to get catastrophically higher as temperatures rise.

    _Truth:_ Mainstream estimates say **hurricanes will be less frequent and between 1-10% more intense at 2° C warming. This is not at all catastrophic** if we continue our fossil-fueled climate mastery.[^6]

    ![Likelihood Statements](/img/likelihood-statements.png)

- _Myth:_ We face catastrophic increases in dangerous wildfires, an “Earth on fire.”

    While the media increasingly reports on fires and draws connections to warming, **the world burns less than 20 years ago and far less than 100 years ago.** Fire danger primarily depends on human mastery.[^7]

    ![Global Burned Area](/img/global-burned-area-1901-2020.jpg)

- _Myth:_ Rising CO2 levels will destroy the planet’s “ecosystems,” and eventually us with them.

    _Truth:_ **A warmer world,** which is also a wetter world, with more CO2, **is generally better for life.** And **increasing mastery gives us more ability to preserve the most valuable species.**

- **If we consider the incredible mastery that fossil fuels have given and can continue to give us,** and then look at the plausible climate challenges FFs could create, we conclude that **mastery will continue to overwhelm challenges**—and thus FFs can continue to drive climate safety.

- Given that the climate mastery we get from fossil fuels will continue to outweigh any climate challenges that come from FFs, **government should absolutely not be “addressing climate change” by opposing FFs. That would increase climate danger,** among many other terrible outcomes.

- **Those who want to prioritize reducing GHG emissions should do so,** not by forcibly depriving other people of energy, but **by private actions**—above all **innovating truly cost-effective alternatives** to fossil fuels that people will voluntarily adopt.

- Not only is innovation the only moral way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is the only globally practical way—because **energy-valuing nations like China and India will continue to use fossil fuels until there is a real, cost-effective alternative.**[^8]

- **The key to low-CO2 energy innovation** is the same as the key to global energy abundance: **leave us free to produce and use all forms of energy, including fossil fuels.** This requires removing the many obstacles the government puts in the way of cost-effective energy.

- One impediment toward energy innovation is the anti-development policies that make it take forever to experiment with and develop new energy technologies—all of which involve developing nature.

    **We need government to liberate domestic development.**

- A huge impediment to energy innovation is the many anti-nuclear policies that have turned nuclear from a cost-competitive form of electricity many decades ago into a cost nightmare today.

    **We need to unleash nuclear from myriad irrational policies, including “LNT” and “ALARA.”**

- Summary: **Government should stop fixating on trying to eliminate climate challenges** caused by fossil fuels—i.e., “climate change”—because those challenges can continue to be mastered using fossil fuels.

    **Government should focus exclusively on energy freedom for both fossil fuels and alternatives.**
