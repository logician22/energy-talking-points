***Government should remove all preferences for electric vehicles and allow them to compete and grow on a free market.***

***This will enable EVs to reach their full potential to provide affordable, no-tailpipe-emissions transport without harming consumers or the grid.***

### Background

EVs have generated excitement because they have some performance advantages and no tailpipe emissions. However, **EVs aren't currently cost-effective for most uses and face scalability issues** with America's inadequate grid and small-scale production of key EV materials.[^1]

### Goals for good EV policy

Good EV policy should **unleash whatever potential EVs have** to be a cost-effective, scalable alternative to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but **not harm consumers or the grid** by imposing EVs before they are truly cost-effective and scalable.

### Today's anti-freedom EV policy

**EVs get massive subsidies** via tax credits (“Inflation Reduction Act”), **which coerce drivers into using EVs** even when they're not truly cost-effective. And the **EPA plans** emissions regulations so strict that they would **ban most ICE sales by 2032.**[^2]

### False rationale for EV preferences

Myth: Fossil fuels have created a “climate emergency” that can only be ended if we mass-adopt EVs.

Truth: **Fossil fuels have created unprecedented climate safety with no need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions—which scalability-challenged EVs can't do anyway.**[^3]

- America is not in a “climate emergency”.

    **Rising CO2 levels are:**
    - **Not dire:** Humans are safer from climate than ever.

    - **Not temporary:** They will rise for decades.

    - **Not in our control:** We emit 1/7 of CO2—and falling.[^4]

- If we were in a climate emergency, forced EVs wouldn't help much.

    With current “green” supply chain regulations pushing production abroad, **any remotely cost-effective EV manufacturing can only happen in places with emissions-intensive production,** like China.[^5]

- While **EVs** have no tailpipe emissions, they **leave the factory with higher emissions from their supply chain than ICEs.** Whether they can catch up with an ICE vehicle of the same size depends on the electricity mix and battery lifetime. But the emissions are never close to zero.[^6]

### Destructive consequences

EV preferences, by forcing us to use far more EVs than we otherwise would, when our grid and domestic supply chains are not ready, **harm Americans via 1) an inferior product at cost to taxpayers, and 2) catastrophic electricity shortages.**

- An inferior product

    Even with massive EV preferences, only 7.6% of vehicles sold in 2023 were EVs—almost all from luxury brands like Tesla. **Most poor and middle class Americans can't afford** to deal with EV cost, range, and inconvenience issues—**and it's immoral to force them to.**[^7]

- Catastrophic electricity shortages

    **America is already in an electricity crisis,** and planned EPA policies threaten to reduce reliable grid capacity 20% by 2030.

    **Our government's plan to mass-mandate electricity-hungry EVs would lead to a third-world grid.**\

- **CA is already having major problems with EV charging.** On Aug 31, 2022, the CA grid operator urged consumers to cut electricity usage during a heatwave, including using less airconditioning(!) and refraining from “charging electric vehicles.”

    Imagine what would happen with over 50% EVs.[^8]

### A new energy freedom policy

Establish a truly free auto market by abolishing EV subsidies and other fuel subsidies.

- **End EV subsidies:** Remove all EV tax credits

- **Prevent the EV mandate:** Direct the EPA to cancel their proposed greenhouse gas standards that would de-facto ban most ICEs

### Common misconception about EV preferences

Myth: Without government EV preferences, we lose out on potential EV benefits such as low maintenance costs, lower overall costs, and lower urban air pollution.

Truth: **EV freedom allows us to take advantage of any real EV benefits** as and when they arise at scale.

### Positive consequences

If EVs compete on a truly free market, **Americans will be free to drive whatever car they judge best** for their needs. **EV makers and supporters will be incentivized to actually deliver a superior product,** including a grid with adequate electricity.

    For every million people on earth, annual deaths from climate-related causes (extreme temperature, drought, flood, storms, wildfires) declined 98%--from an average of 247 per year during the 1920s to 2.5 per year during the 2010s.
