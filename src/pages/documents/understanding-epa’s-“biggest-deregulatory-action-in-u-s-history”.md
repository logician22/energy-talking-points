**Did the EPA really just take the “Biggest Deregulatory Action in U.S. History”?**

**Arguably, yes.**

**Here are 18 important deregulatory actions EPA announced today, and why they will make life better for all of us.** (I posted a version of these points on Twitter/X yesterday; so far it has over a million views, and has been shared publicly by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.)

1. **“Reconsideration of regulations on power plants (Clean Power Plan 2.0)”**

    These Biden regulations would effectively ban all coal plants and new natural gas plants by demanding impossible 90% carbon capture.[^1]

    Reconsidering them is essential to preserving the grid and unleashing electricity.

 2. **“Reconsideration of light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicle regulations”**

    These Biden regulations paved the way for the EV mandate by imposing unachievable emission standards on gas vehicles.[^2]

    Reconsidering them is essential for preserving automotive choice.

3. **“Reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding”**

    This Obama-era determination, by declaring CO2 dangerous, allowed Biden to shut down power plants, slow US oil growth, and lock up our limitless natural gas.[^3]

    Reconsidering it is essential for American energy dominance.

4. **“Ending so-called ‘Good Neighbor Plan’”**

    This Biden rule set ozone-related emissions levels so (unnecessarily) low that many vital coal power plants can’t comply—even though ozone levels are very low throughout the US.[^4]

    Ending it is essential to preserving grid reliability.

5. **“Reconsideration of Particulate Matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards”**

    These Biden regulations demand hugely costly cuts to US PM2.5 levels, which are already very low and safe.[^5]

    Reconsidering them is crucial to keeping American energy and industry globally competitive.

6. **“Reconsideration of limitations, guidelines and standards (ELG) for the Steam Electric Power Generating Industry”**

    These Biden regulations throttle coal power generation by imposing needlessly stringent wastewater standards.[^6]

    Reconsidering them is important to preserving our grid.

7. **“Reconsideration of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards”**

    These Biden regulations impose draconian mercury and other emission limits on coal plants, requiring costly retrofits or shutdowns with little or no health benefit.[^7]

    Reconsidering them is essential to preserving grid reliability.

8. **“Restructuring the Regional Haze Program”**

    This EPA program imposes major costs on electricity producers for minimal visibility improvements in low-populated areas.[^8]

    Restructuring it is crucial for facilitating affordable and reliable electricity.

9. **“Prioritizing coal ash program to expedite state permit reviews and update coal ash regulations (CCR Rule)”**

    These Biden regulations impose an impossible compliance timeline for coal ash disposal.[^9]

    Fixing them is crucial will preserve the grid while responsibly managing coal ash.

10. **“Overhauling Biden-Harris Administration’s ‘Social Cost of Carbon’”**

    This Biden method of calculating the costs of CO2 emissions allows EPA to vastly exaggerate the benefits of its regulations.[^10]

    Overhauling it is essential for restoring real cost-benefit analyses to the EPA.

11. **“Reconstituting Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee”**

    Biden stacked these scientific panels in favor of harsh regulations on energy producers.

    Making these panels more balanced is critical for the EPA’s ability to unleash American energy.

12. **“Reconsideration of exceptional events rulemaking”**

    This EPA policy requires states to undergo complex procedures for exempting prescribed fires from strict air quality standards.[^11]

    Revisiting it is vital for enabling safe, controlled burns that prevent catastrophic wildfires.

13. **“Reconsideration of regulations throttling the oil and gas industry (OOOO b/c)”**

    These Biden regulations would effectively shut down smaller producers by imposing high-cost methane capture requirements.[^12]

    Reconsidering them is essential to maximizing American oil and gas production.

14. **“Reconsideration of multiple National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants”**

    These EPA regulations impose costly emission controls on industries like iron and steel, tire manufacturing, and chemicals.[^13]

    Reconsidering them is crucial for unleashing American manufacturing.

15. **“Reconsideration of mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program”**

    This Biden program demands pointlessly detailed emission tracking from emitters of over 25,000 metric tons/year of CO2.[^14]

    Reconsidering it could save productive companies countless wasted millions and hours.

16. **“Working with states and tribes to resolve massive backlog with State Implementation Plans and Tribal Implementation Plans”**

    These EPA backlogs deprive states of control over their electricity mix.

    Resolving them is essential to preserving local grid reliability.

17. **“Redirecting enforcement resources to EPA’s core mission”**

    The Biden administration used its enforcement power to pressure energy producers into costly settlements.

    Recalibrating this is essential to protecting the rule of law and establishing American energy dominance.

18. **“Terminating Biden’s Environmental Justice and DEI arms of the agency”**

    These Biden initiatives diverted resources from even-handed enforcement of the law to identity-based agendas.[^15]

    Ending them is crucial to restoring the rule of law and ensuring EPA serves all Americans.
