**Today Congress decides whether it’ll be easy or hard to build in the US.**

**Currently, thanks to “NEPA,” it takes forever to get a permit to build things—from pipelines to data centers to highways.**

**Tell your Representative to fix this: Vote YES on SPEED Act + Amendments 34/35/36!**

- **The SPEED Act[^1], co-sponsored by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR-4) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME-2), dramatically reduces delays from project-wrecking NEPA reviews** by

    1) requiring a reasonable scope of review
    2) avoiding duplicative reviews
    3) reducing frivolous lawsuits
    4) reducing the delaying power of lawsuits

- **1: SPEED requires a reasonable, not unlimited, scope of review—saving years of useless paperwork** for key projects such as pipelines and LNG terminals.

    E.g., under NEPA’s traditional, unlimited scope of review, the 88-mile Uinta Basin oil rail line required a 3600 page review!

- **2: SPEED avoids duplicative reviews—saving months or years of reviews for projects** that have already been reviewed for NEPA or by states.

    E.g., currently, a project that spent years completing environmental analysis for CA law must repeat essentially the same analysis for NEPA.

- **3: SPEED reduces the number of frivolous lawsuits—avoiding hundreds of politically driven lawsuits per year for major projects** like pipelines and transmission lines.

    E.g., the Mountain Valley Pipeline was sued again and again over alleged paperwork issues in its NEPA review.

- **4: SPEED reduces the delaying power of lawsuits—saving years of delays and protecting hundreds of billions in expenditures** for pipelines, power lines, roads, and mines.

    E.g., Mountain Valley took 10 years to permit and build since it stopped for years at a time during lawsuits.

- **The SPEED Act protects and even improves environmental quality.** It does not change the substance of environmental law but it does allow environmental improvement to happen more quickly.

    E.g., NEPA delays often stop anti-wildfire measures like controlled burns or brush-clearing.

- To improve the core text of SPEED—which is itself a major improvement of NEPA—**House members have sponsored 3 key amendments to SPEED (#34, #35, #36) that will further reduce NEPA delays** to the benefit of all major projects, from pipelines to transmission lines to data centers.

- **Amendment 34 to SPEED, led by Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA-9), ensures that only truly affected people, not anti-development activists, can sue under NEPA to stop projects.**[^2]

    If this is passed, fewer crucial projects will get stopped by frivolous NEPA lawsuits.

- **Amendment 35 to SPEED, led by Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA-10), ensures that when conducting NEPA reviews, agencies review only what they can legally regulate, not everything they can imagine.**[^3]

    If this is passed, more crucial projects will get permitted quickly while preserving safety.
    ![ Amendment for H.R. 4776 Page 5](/img/amendment_hr_4776_p5.jpg)

- **Amendment 36 to SPEED, led by Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX-21), reserves the most onerous form of NEPA reviews (”EIS”) for direct threats to humans, not speculative effects on remote concerns.**[^4]

    If this is passed, most projects will get permitted quickly, with fewer unnecessary delays.

- If House Republicans and Democrats pass SPEED Act + Amendments 34, 35, 36, America will have cheaper energy, new infrastructure, world-leading AI, more security—and high environmental quality.

**Tell your Representative to vote YES on the SPEED Act AND Amendments 34, 35, 36!**
