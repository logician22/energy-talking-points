- **Myth: Just a small area of solar panels plus storage can power the world.**

    **Truth: Storing just 3 days of global energy would cost $590 trillion at Elon Musk’s current prices. And the panels would take up more space than all the world’s cities, towns, and villages combined.**[^1]
    ![Solar Myth false](/img/musk-solar-only-false-2.png)

- We often hear that just a small area of solar panels plus storage batteries can power the world.

    **“Such an obvious move”** says **Elon Musk** about this idea, adding **“Even solar plus batteries on a small section of Spain would solve EU energy needs.”**

    This is dangerously false.

- **Musk says that “to power the whole Earth” we need just solar panels and “some batteries.”**

    What is “some batteries”?

    **To store a mere 3 days of world energy,** to be prepared for weeks (let alone seasons) with lower-than-usual sunlight, takes **>1,350 terawatt-hours in batteries.**[^2]

- The world uses over 165k TWh of energy annually, or ~1.36 billion MWh in 3 days. **1000 Tesla Megapacks (3916 MWh of storage) have a price over >$1.7 billion.** This would mean **3 days of storage using Tesla batteries would cost >$590 trillion. That's 6X world GDP!**[^3]

- For those who think $590 trillion in batteries will somehow soon become cheap due to economies of scale, consider this: Tesla Megapack prices have been increasing, not rapidly decreasing, lately.

    And **efforts to scale batteries on an artificial timetable drive up prices.**[^4]

- **The focus by Elon Musk and others on the space taken up by solar panels and batteries dodges the real issue: cost-effectiveness.**

    Due to stratospheric battery storage costs, **no amount of solar panels can cost-effectively power the world.**

- **Arguing that solar panels and batteries can provide energy to 8 billion people using modest space is like arguing that Rolls-Royces can transport 8 billion people using modest space.**

    Yes, there’s **space** for 8 billion Rolls-Royces—but the **human time it would take to produce them is cost-prohibitive.**

- Another reason the world can’t be powered by solar panels and batteries: these only provide electricity—currently 1/5 of the world’s energy. **Electricity can’t power many uses of energy (flight, cargo ships) and is very costly for others (many forms of industrial process heat).**

- The main lie of “Just a small area of solar panels can power the world” is that it ignores the insane cost of the necessary batteries.

    But it also **drastically underestimates how much space solar panels require.**

    **For example, this viral Twitter post underestimates the area by some 25 times.**[^5]
    ![Solar space requirements vs Musk](/img/musk-solar-only-combo.png)

- The world uses >165,000 TWh of energy per year, which requires ~19 billion kW of power output on average. An optimistic, real-world power density for solar projects is 10 W/m^2. **To power the world, you’d need ~1.8 million km^2 of solar PV projects—about the size of Libya.**[^6]
    ![Actual solar requirement](/img/real-solar-requirements.png)

- If 1.8 million square km of solar panels doesn’t seem like much, note that it is **more than all cities, towns, villages, and human infrastructure combined** (~1.5 million sq km).

    And this excludes the **huge footprints of solar and battery mining, manufacturing, and transmission.**[^7]

- **Summary: While we are told that the world can be powered by a small area of solar panels and batteries, the storage costs involved are impossibly high (hundreds of $trillions) and the panels involved would take up more area than all the world’s cities, towns, and villages combined.**

- The idea that the world can be powered by a small area of solar panels and batteries has been a **major cause of today’s global energy crisis.**

    **The world artificially restricted fossil fuel supply because smart people like Elon Musk told us we could use solar and batteries instead.**

- **Elon Musk has dramatically improved his energy rhetoric over the last year,** acknowledging the need for oil and gas and walking back his past climate catastrophism. But **he and others need to stop spreading the deadly idea that solar and batteries can power the world.**[^8]
