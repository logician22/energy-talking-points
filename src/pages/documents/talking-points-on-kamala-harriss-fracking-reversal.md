Myth: Kamala Harris used to be for banning fracking, but now she supports fracking.

Truth: **Kamala Harris is still for banning fracking—because she is still for the** ***net-zero agenda that requires banning fracking*** along with all other fossil fuel activities.
    ![Kamala Ban Fracking Still True](/img/kamala-ban-fracking-still-true.jpg)

- **Kamala Harris**, who in 2019 said, “There is no question I am in favor of banning fracking,” **now tells voters in fracking-dependent states like Pennsylvania that she is no longer wants to ban fracking.**

    **They shouldn’t believe her**, since Harris’s net-zero agenda _requires_ banning fracking.[^1]

- To know what to make of Harris’s reversal on a fracking ban, we need to first recognize that **banning fracking would have been one of the most harmful policies in US history.** It would have destroyed 60% of our oil production and 75% of our natural gas production.[^2]

- **Fracking is very likely the single most beneficial technological development of the last 25 years.** By extracting cheap, abundant oil and natural gas from once useless rock, it has made energy far cheaper than it would otherwise be.

- Fracking and agriculture: The availability of food is highly determined by the cost of oil, which powers crucial machinery, and gas, which is the basis of the fertilizer that allows us to feed 8 billion people. **Thanks to fracking, the world is far better fed than it would otherwise be.**

- Given how life-giving fracking is to humanity and how essential it is to the prosperity and security of the US, **any politician who has ever suggested banning fracking should be considered an energy menace** until and unless they issue a deeply reflective apology.

- **Harris and others who have advocated banning fracking should apologize** along the following lines: “I called for banning something crucial because I listened only to exaggerated claims about its negatives and ignored its huge benefits. I am deeply sorry, and pledge to do better.”

- **Someone who comes to understand why it’s wrong to ban fracking**—because the benefits you would destroy are far greater than the harms you would avoid—**should also understand that the same problem exists with the broader anti-fossil-fuel, “net zero” agenda.**

- Harris has not apologized whatsoever for her support of a murderous fracking ban.

    And far from questioning the anti-fossil-fuel, “net zero” agenda, she has remained 100% committed to it.

    Which means **she’s an enemy of not just fracking but all fossil fuel use.**

- The guiding energy goal of Biden/Harris is “net zero by 2050”—rapidly banning activities that add CO2 to the atmosphere.

    Since there’s no scalable way to capture CO2, burning fossil fuels necessarily means more CO2.

    **“Net zero” = “ban most fossil fuel use”—including fracking.**[^3]

- Given that “net zero by 2050” requires banning virtually all fossil fuel activity, the whole conversation about whether Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking is absurd.

    **You can’t be for fracking and for net-zero anymore than you can be for penicillin and for banning all antibiotics.**

- For “net zero by 2050” advocates there’s no question of _if_ they want to ban particular fossil fuel activities such as fracking in the next 25 years, just _when_ and _in what order._

    If Harris doesn’t try to ban fracking soon she’ll just try to ban other vital fossil fuel activities.

- **The Biden-Harris administration has already shown us that they will try to do everything they can to ban fossil fuels in pursuit of net-zero**—and that they will only be limited by pro-fossil-fuel political opponents’ opposition and the resistance of voters.

- **Both Biden and Harris made it clear when campaigning that their guiding energy goal was “net zero by 2050” and that meant rapidly banning fossil fuels.**

    Biden: “I guarantee you, we’re going to end fossil fuel.” Harris’s cosponsored Green New Deal called for banning fossil fuels.[^4]

- **When they entered office, Biden and Harris continued to make “net zero by 2050” their guiding goal** by rejoining the Paris Agreement that committed us to it and by announcing a “whole of government” focus on “climate”—code for: rapidly getting rid of fossil fuels.[^5]
    ![Executive Order Clean Energy](/img/executive-order-clean-energy.jpg)

- **In action after action, the Biden-Harris administration has shown us that it will do anything it can get away with politically to rapidly eliminate fossil fuels:** pipeline blocking, Federal leasing bans, LNG prohibitions, power plant shutdowns, EV mandates, SEC rules, etc, etc.\

- **Americans have already paid a high price for the Biden-Harris administration’s net-zero agenda**—high energy bills, power shortages, and inflation.

    **But we’d be paying a far higher price had pro-fossil-fuel politicians and voters not opposed and dramatically slowed the agenda.**[^6]

- Most of what Biden-Harris have tried to do to rapidly eliminate fossil fuel use has been, thankfully, slowed by opposition: lawsuits over power plant shutdowns, courts reversing illegal leasing bans, etc.

    Without this opposition they would have already caused energy ruin.[^7]

- Consider: America desperately needs more reliable power plants given huge demand from AI and (Biden-mandated) EVs.

    But the Biden-Harris EPA has tried to shut down all coal—1/6 of reliable capacity!

    **Were it not for Biden-Harris opponents we’d already have a 3rd-world grid.**[^8]\

- **Harris tries to act reassure us that she’s “moderate” because Biden-Harris hasn’t destroyed oil and gas**—e.g., fracking is allowed and oil production has actually increased.

    **But that’s because opposition has moderated her insanely destructive net-zero ambitions.**

- **The only way Kamala Harris can validly convince the public that she’s not an energy threat is to renounce not only her support of a fracking ban but of the “net zero” agenda**—and to correct the anti-fossil-fuel bias that leads to both of these murderous policy ideas.

- **Whenever you hear a politician claim to be a friend of oil and gas, fracking, or any other aspect of fossil fuels, ask one simple question: Do you renounce the “net zero” agenda?**

    If not, they will work to destroy fossil fuels—and with them our energy, prosperity, and security.
