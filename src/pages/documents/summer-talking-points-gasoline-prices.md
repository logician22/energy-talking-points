_This is Part 1 of a 4 part feature where I cover 4 of the top energy issues being discussed this summer, especially as politicians return home for August Recess._
_________________________________________________

**Any politician who supports the “net zero” agenda is working to make gasoline prices much higher.**

- Every politician will claim this summer that they’re working to make gasoline prices lower, because they know that’s what voters want to hear.

    But **the many politicians that support “net zero by 2050” are working to make gasoline prices higher.**

- For the US to become anywhere near “net zero by 2050,” gasoline use needs to be virtually eliminated.[^1]

- Since Americans left to their own free will choose to use a lot of gasoline, the only way for “net zero” politicians to eliminate gasoline is to make it unaffordable or illegal.

    **Low gasoline prices are totally incompatible with “net zero.”**

- **The Biden-Harris administration knows that all fossil fuels, including gasoline, need to be far more expensive for them to pursue “net zero.”** That’s why the EPA set a rising “social cost of carbon” starting at $190/ton—the equivalent of adding $1.50 a gallon to gasoline prices![^2]

- **From Day 1, President Biden has openly supported the destruction of the fossil fuel industry,** from his 2019 campaign promise of “I guarantee you, we’re going to end fossil fuel” to his 2021 executive order declaring that America will be “net zero emissions economy-wide” by 2050.[^3]

- **Kamala Harris has, unfortunately, been even more supportive of the “net zero” agenda** and therefore higher gasoline prices. In 2020 she supported **a fracking ban, which would have destroyed 60% of US oil production.** And she cosponsored the fossil fuel-destroying Green New Deal.[^4]

- Of course, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, like all politicians, claim to be for lower gasoline prices. But **because their real priority is the “net zero” agenda, in practice they are doing everything they can to raise prices.**

    Here are 8 specific actions they’ve taken.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #1**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by taking a “whole-of-government” approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.** This entails reducing oil investment, production, refining, and transport, all of which serves to increase gas prices.[^5]

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #2**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by expanding the anti-fossil-fuel ESG divestment movement.** ESG contributed to a 50% decline in oil and gas exploration investments from 2011-2021, resulting in artificially higher prices. Biden is making it worse.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #3**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices via “climate disclosure rules,”** an oil and gas investment-slashing measure that coerces companies into spouting anti-fossil-fuel propaganda and committing to anti-fossil-fuel plans—plans that will raise gas prices.

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #4**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by issuing a moratorium on oil and gas leases on federal lands, stunting oil and gas production and investment.** When it’s harder to produce and invest in oil, gasoline gets more expensive.[^6]
    ![Biden Halts Oil and Gas Leases](/img/biden-leases-permits.jpg)

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #5**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by hiking the royalty rate for new oil leases by 50%.** This is money the government gets from the industry on top of taxes. And it discourages oil investments, meaning less production meaning higher gas prices.[^7]

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #6**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by restricting oil and gas leasing on nearly 50% of Alaska's vast petroleum reserve.** This is a crippling blow to Alaska's oil and gas industry. Less Alaskan oil means higher gas prices.[^8]

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #7**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by threatening to stop oil and gas mergers.** Mergers, which increase efficiency, benefit domestic production and lower prices. Blocking mergers raises oil prices long-term, which means higher gas prices.

    ![Why government should leave oil and gas mergers alone](https://energytalkingpoints.com/why-government-should-leave-oil-and-gas-mergers-alone/)

- **Biden Gas Gouging Policy #8**

    **Biden has worked to increase gasoline prices by cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline.** This prevented Canada from using its vast oil deposits to their full potential—meaning lower global supply and higher prices for oil and gasoline.[^9]
    ![Biden Cancels Keystone Pipeline](/img/biden-keystone-pipeline.jpg)

- **Joe Biden should level with the American people and make clear that his agenda is to increase gasoline prices**—much like Obama’s infamous admission that “electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket” under his energy plan.

    Or he should apologize and embrace energy freedom.[^10]
