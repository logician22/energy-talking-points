**_Myth: Solar and wind are helping save our grid from extreme heat caused by fossil-fueled climate change._**

**_Truth: Preferences for S+W have made our grid embarrassingly vulnerable to heat waves—and cold snaps—that a fossil-fueled grid could easily manage._**

-   A recent Bloomberg story, “In Texas Heat Wave, ACs Keep Humming on Renewable Power” captures an **increasingly popular argument: fossil-fueled climate change is causing overwhelming heat waves, while solar and wind are coming to the rescue with abundant electricity**.  
      
    All wrong.[^1]
    
-   Myth: Fossil-fueled climate change is causing heat waves that our grids will inevitably have trouble handling.  
      
    Truth: The amount of warming that has occurred—**about 2°F in 100 years**—**wouldn't challenge a grid fueled by fossil fuels** and other reliable, resilient fuel sources.
    
-   The wide-ranging potential for extreme heat in California or Texas and the extreme cold potential in Texas every few decades is far greater than the slow-moving changes in climate. **An extreme heat wave and high electricity demand in summer are not unexpected for grid planners**.
    
-   Around the world, **countries use fossil fuels to deliver reliable electricity under heat and cold extremes** beyond what we face in the US.  
      
    As the wealthiest country in the world, obviously, the US could replicate this.  
      
    **The cause is obviously something other than fossil fuels.**
    
-   An example of **fossil-fueled electricity thriving** **in extremely hot weather**: **Singapore, which has both growing electricity demand and temperatures comparable to those of African countries** like Chad and the Ivory Coast.[^2]  ![electricity-prod-source-stacked](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ccbf091-cf36-46b4-934d-46be3dd24175_3400x2400.png)
    
-   An example of **fossil-fueled electricity thriving in extremely cold weather**:  
      
    During the cold week that overwhelmed Texas's solar-and-wind-favoring grid, causing blackouts, the **weatherized coal and gas infrastructure** in **Alberta, Canada was able to handle far colder temperatures than Texas**.[^3]![TX Calagary comparison](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01fafbf5-0ff8-41ee-922d-20adc36cfa77_1466x958.jpeg)
    
-   **No conceivable warming of the planet could cause heat waves that would be a problem for a grid that's committed to reliable electricity**. Just invest enough in reliable sources like natural gas, coal, and nuclear, and any necessary weatherization infrastructure.
    
-   The reason that Texas and the rest of the US are having trouble meeting electricity demand that should be no problem is the obvious: **policies that punish reliable fossil fuels and nuclear** while **privileging unreliable solar and wind**.

-   Myth: The Texas winter blackouts were a failure of fossil fuels, especially natural gas.  
      
    Truth: **Fossil fuels perform great in far worse winter weather than Texas had in 2021**. Texas blackouts were caused by **defunding fossil fuel resiliency** to pay for unreliable solar and wind.

-   Myth: Fossil fuels are making electricity unreliable via “extreme weather”—so we need to use solar and wind.  
      
    Truth: **Fossil fuels can provide reliable electricity even under the most speculative extremes**—whereas **unreliable solar and wind alone can’t provide it** under any conditions.
    
-   The latest attempt to pretend that fossil fuels are causing electricity problems that can only be solved by solar and wind is to **dishonestly fixate on the moments during a heatwave when solar and wind happen to produce electricity** and ignore (the many more) moments they don't.[^4]![Bloomberg article](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae5c11e-a167-45b5-93b7-224204bab199_1506x1356.png)
    
-   Myth: Solar and wind are saving Texas during heat waves because they happened to produce a lot of energy portions of a few hot days.  
      
    Truth: **Preferences for unreliable solar and wind**—which are often low when needed the most—**have made Texas embarrassingly vulnerable** to heat waves (and cold snaps).
    
-   Bloomberg: “Texas may be known for its oil and natural gas, but as temperatures breach 100F across the state for a full two weeks, it’s wind and solar power that's helping keep residents cool.”  
      
    This “journalism” is false solar and wind propaganda that should be retracted.
    
-   Bloomberg: “Texas may be known for its oil and natural gas, but... for a full two weeks, it’s been wind and solar power that helped keep residents cool.”  
      
    False: Solar and wind provided higher than average unreliable electricity that totally depended on reliable gas, coal, and nuclear.[^5]![ERCOt solar wind June 2023](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393b6c67-1e06-409a-a33e-4dce675aa8b4_6116x3991.png)
    
-   Bloomberg: “Green-power sources contributed about a third of total output Wednesday.”  
      
    This is blatant **cherry-picking: taking an unusually good day of sunlight and wind and pretending it can be generalized**. Also, the unreliable output was **100% dependent on fossil-fueled life support**.
    
-   Even during the period of unusually high solar and wind that Bloomberg cherry-picked to claim “ACs Keep Humming on Renewable Power,” **solar and wind at times provided < 20% of Texas electricity**. Of course, that portion of the time didn't make the Bloomberg story.![Bloomberg ERCOT snapshot](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F821e42ba-e914-444f-9e9e-5104e11e2c28_1600x900.png)
    
-   **Solar and wind haven't supported the Texas power grid even for a day**—and can't. **Solar goes to zero every hot night**, delivering nothing to air conditioning, and **wind frequently cycles from <20% to >60% of its supposed “capacity.”** (More accurately called “fantasy.”)
    
-   Bloomberg: “grid officials have only had to ask consumers to conserve energy on one day since extreme temperatures descended on the Lone Star State”  
      
    **A proper grid focused on reliability should almost never “ask consumers to conserve energy.”** Its job is to meet all demand.
    
-   “We’ve seen record demand, but we’ve also got quite a bit of wind and solar producing. While demand is really high, so is supply.” —Bloomberg “expert” celebrating that solar and wind happen to help meet demand. **Reliable sources always match high demand with high supply**.
    
-   Bloomberg: “In just three years, oil-rich Texas has added the solar equivalent of 12 nuclear reactors”  
      
    **There is no “solar equivalent of nuclear reactors.”** Nuclear reactors work all the time, including at night. **Solar often doesn't work during the day and never works at night**.
    
-   It is **embarrassing that Texas and the US more broadly are having trouble providing enough electricity** during heat waves and cold snaps.  
      
    And it is despicable that **the media are ignoring the anti-reliability policies causing the problem** **and instead** **praising unreliable solar and wind**.
