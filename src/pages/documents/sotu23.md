**I can summarize the economic portion of Biden’s State of the Union speech in one word: evasion.**

**President Biden is evading responsibility for the consequences of the anti-freedom, anti-development, anti-fossil-fuel policies he has supported.**

**Things won’t get better until he’s held accountable.**

- In the economic portion of his State of the Union speech, **Joe Biden focused on 3 problems: 1) the decline of US industry and infrastructure, 2) the global energy crisis, and 3) the supply chain crisis.**

    While Biden portrayed himself as the solution to all 3 problems, he is in fact a major cause.[^1]

- **1: Biden’s role in the decline of US industry and infrastructure**

    Why have US industry and infrastructure declined?

    **Because industry and infrastructure require development**—and we have, with Biden’s support, been passing **anti-development environmental policies** for 50+ years.

- **One of the anti-development environmental policies crippling American industry and infrastructure is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).**

    The previous administration made some valuable NEPA reforms, which Biden immediately overturned.\
    [Talking Points on the need for NEPA reform](https://energytalkingpoints.com/nepa/)

- In his State of the Union speech Joe Biden repeatedly heralded the **new infrastructure law.** But that law, because it **rejected NEPA reform, was actually an anti-infrastructure law** that makes the projects it supports, along with many, many others, unnecessarily difficult.\
    [Talking Points on the need for NEPA reform](https://energytalkingpoints.com/nepa/)

- The root solution to our industry and manufacturing problems is to **liberate responsible development.** By totally failing to do this, **Biden’s “buy American” policies will just subsidize inefficient operations and increase our cost of living** even more.

- In his State of the Union speech, Joe Biden asked **“Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?”**

    The answer: It is written **in the endless anti-development industrial regulations** that Biden is only adding to.[^2]

- **2: Biden’s role in the global energy crisis**

    In his State of the Union speech Joe Biden portrayed the global energy crisis as a **problem that he is solving. In fact, it’s a problem he has helped cause with anti-fossil-fuel policies—and is making worse with new anti-fossil-fuel policies.**

- **Biden’s sole explanation for the global energy crisis was “Putin’s war.” But the root cause is global anti-fossil-fuel policies, supported by Biden—which made fossil fuel prices artificially high pre-war and prevented the free world from quickly increasing production in response.**

- Here’s an in-depth explanation I gave at a Congressional off-site last year of how the global anti-fossil-fuel movement, including the Biden administration, caused the global energy crisis—including its major impacts on inflation.\
    [Testimony: "How the Biden Administration and the Global Anti-Fossil-Fuel Movement Caused an Energy Crisis and Inflated Our Cost of Living"](https://energytalkingpoints.com/energy-crisis-testimony/)

- As I have documented extensively, **had Biden and other Democrats spent the last 3.5 years (including the 2 of the Biden admin) liberating US oil and gas investment, production, and transport instead of strangling them, energy would be far cheaper.**\
    [America’s energy crisis is mostly US Democrats’ fault](https://energytalkingpoints.com/dems/)

- Instead of taking any responsibility whatsoever for the disastrous shortage of fossil fuels today, President “I guarantee you, we’re going to end fossil fuel” Biden **continues engaging in a denial campaign that blames everyone but him and his allies.**\
    [Talking Points on US Democrats engaging in epic denial on oil and gasoline prices](https://energytalkingpoints.com/democrat-denial/)

- Biden’s **bragging about gasoline prices being “down $1.50 a gallon since their peak”** is inane because **1) he helped cause that peak, 2) prices would be lower without his policies, and 3) his only downward influence has been irresponsibly draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.**\
    [How Biden’s abuse of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to win votes harms our energy security](https://energytalkingpoints.com/spr/)

- Not only has Biden been a significant cause of the global energy crisis, **he has taken actions to compound** it by **1) passing the disastrous, anti-fossil-fuel “Inflation Reduction Act” and 2) continuing to threaten fossil fuel producers.**\
    [The “Inflation Reduction Act” is a 4-step recipe for destroying American energy](https://energytalkingpoints.com/ira-recipe/)

- **Biden’s State of the Union speech threats to “Big Oil” and its “outrageous” profits** will only compound one of his biggest energy sins: **threatening the fossil fuel industry’s future** (with lower profits) and then complaining that they won’t produce more.

- Biden somehow thought he was reassuring oil companies and Americans by saying **“we’re gonna need oil for at least another decade.”** But this **delusionally short-term view of oil’s future** just signals he is going to keep harming the industry.\
    [Republicans laugh hysterically when Biden says "we're gonna need oil for at least another decade!"](https://twitter.com/townhallcom/status/1623150198196211712)

- To justify his past and present anti-fossil-fuel policies, **Biden claimed—with no evidence—that there is a “climate crisis” that's an “existential threat.”** Whereas in reality there is “climate change” but thanks to increasing resilience a rapid decline in climate disaster deaths.[^3]

- Here’s a full explanation of how the **false equivalence between “climate change” and “climate crisis”** has caused today’s global energy crisis.\
    [How a fake climate emergency created a real energy emergency](https://energytalkingpoints.com/fake-emergency/)

- Until Biden and the rest of the anti-fossil-fuel movement are held accountable for causing the global energy crisis, they **will continue to compound that crisis by continuing to oppose fossil fuel investment, production, refining, and transport.**

- **3: Biden’s role in the supply chain crisis**

    In his State of the Union speech Biden blamed the supply chain crisis on “the pandemic.” But **Biden and others bear responsibility for pro-lockdown pandemic policies that caused massive unnecessary damage.**

- The **supply chain crisis is caused in part by bad pandemic policies but also by general hostility toward industry, development, and economic freedom** by the Biden administration and many other world leaders–hostility that makes it hard for supply chains to recover.

- **For a pro-freedom approach to Covid-19 and other infectious diseases, see this excellent white-paper** (which I am proud to have been a contributor to) by philosopher Onkar Ghate of the Ayn Rand Institute.\
    [Ayn Rand Institute - A Pro-Freedom Approach to Infectious Disease](https://newideal.aynrand.org/pandemic-response/)

- **Summary: President Biden’s State of the Union speech systematically evaded responsibility for the disastrous consequences of the anti-freedom, anti-development, anti-fossil-fuel policies Biden has supported.**

    Going forward, we need 1) accountability and 2) alternatives.

- Those who object to President Biden’s terrible economic policies, especially energy policies, **need a positive alternative.** I believe the **best alternative in the realm of energy is The Energy Freedom Platform.**\
    [The Energy Freedom Platform](https://energytalkingpoints.com/efp/)

- **To promote energy freedom, Congress should hold hearings on these 4 (and other) energy-related topics.** If any elected officials would like my help on this or any other aspect of promoting energy freedom, send me an email at alex (at) alexepstein (dot) com.\
