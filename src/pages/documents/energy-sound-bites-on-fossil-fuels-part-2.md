_[Last week](https://energytalkingpoints.com/energy-sound-bites-on-fossil-fuels-part-1/) I shared Energy Sound Bites to support the first core truth about fossil fuels: We must think of fossil fuels in a balanced way._

_Today, I’ll share Energy Sound Bites to support the second core truth:_ ***Only by using fossil fuels can 8 billion people have the energy they need to survive and flourish.***
    ![3 core truths about fossil fuels](/img/3-core-truths-about-ffs.jpg)

_As a reminder, the goal of Energy Sound Bites is to distill key facts and insights about energy, environmental, and climate issues into a form—100 characters or less—that’s short enough to remember and repeat whenever you need them._

### Only by using fossil fuels can 8 billion people have the energy they need to survive and flourish.

- Fossil fuels are a uniquely cost-effective and scalable source of energy.

    - **Fossil fuels provide 80%+ of the world’s energy and are growing fast.**
        - Fossil fuels are growing in spite of 100+ years of competition and 20+ years of political hostility.[^1]
        ![growing ff use](/img/growing-ff-use.jpg)

- **Countries that care most about cheap energy are pro-fossil fuels.**
    - China, which uses mostly coal to produce “green” technology, has 300+ coal plants in the pipeline.[^2]

- **Fossil fuels’ success comes from a combination of natural attributes and generations of innovation.**
    - Fossil fuels are uniquely cost-effective due to being naturally stored, concentrated, and abundant.
    - Fossil fuels are uniquely cost-effective due to 100+ years of innovation.
    - Only nuclear rivals fossil fuels’ natural attributes—but it has been crippled by irrational policy.

- **Unreliable solar and wind are nowhere near able to replace fossil fuels.**
    - For most energy needs, solar/wind either can't do what fossil fuels can or are far more expensive.
        - Solar/wind only provide <6% of world energy—and only electricity, which is 1/5 of energy.[^3]
        - Electricity from solar and wind depends on huge subsidies and 24/7 life support from reliable power.
    - Solar and wind’s basic problem is unreliability: they can go near-zero at any time.
        - Solar and wind provide exactly the amount of electricity that’s needed 0% of the time.[^4]
        ![German power grid fluctuations](/img/image-18-solar-and-wind-in-germany-during-week-17-2020.jpg)
        - Since solar and wind are unreliable they don’t replace reliable power, they parasite on it.
        - No grid is near 50% solar and wind without huge parasitism on reliable neighbors.
    - Current battery technology can’t make up for solar and wind’s unreliability.
        - Just 3 days of global solar/wind backup with Elon Musk’s Megapacks would cost ~$320T, >3X global GDP.[^5]

- **Reliable nuclear and geothermal are nowhere near able to replace fossil fuels.**
    - In its current state, nuclear is generations away from being cost-effective on a global scale.
        - Producing as much nuclear energy as fossil fuel by 2050 would require adding four 1GW nuclear plants every day.[^6]
        - A huge obstacle to scaling nuclear is its crippling by unscientific restrictions.
        - US policy in particular is so anti-nuclear that no one can build a plant cheaply anymore.
    - Geothermal as we know it is nothing resembling a scalable, near-term replacement for fossil fuels.
        - Current geothermal is not scalable as it requires rare geological heat reservoirs, e.g., like Iceland’s.
        - “Deep geothermal” has long-term promise, but is in an experimental state and not at all scalable.

- Cost-effective and scalable energy is essential for humans to flourish on Earth.
    - Earth, including Earth’s climate, is a naturally very inhospitable place.
        - Many people operate under the false assumption that Earth is a “delicate nurturer.”
        - On the “delicate nurturer” assumption, unimpacted nature exists in a stable, safe, sufficient balance.
        - On the “delicate nurturer” assumption, humans are “parasite-polluters” whose impact inevitably leads to disaster.
        - In truth, Earth is not a “delicate nurturer” but “wild potential”: dynamic, deficient, and dangerous.
        - In truth, humans are “producer-improvers” who can impact Earth for the better.
    - Humans can only flourish on Earth if we use energy to transform it into an abundant and safe place.
        - Since Earth is naturally deficient and dangerous, we must use energy to make it abundant and safe.
        - Energy powers machines and frees up time to radically amplify and expand humanity’s productive ability.
    - Fossil fuels make possible an unprecedented quality of life.
        - Thanks to cost-effective and scalable fossil fuel energy, the world has never been a better place to live.
        - Energy from fossil fuels is fundamental to modern life, from agriculture to sanitation to medical care.
        - Thanks to energy from fossil fuels, life expectancy and income have skyrocketed.[^7]
        ![human flourishing hockey sticks](/img/hydrocarbons-and-human-flourishing-hockey-sticks.png)
        - As China’s fossil fuel use increased over 600% since 1980, its life expectancy increased by 15 years.[^8]
        - As India’s fossil fuel use increased by over 700% since 1980s, its life expectancy increased by 14 years.[^9]
        ![China and India development](/img/energy-use-vs-life-expectancy-at-birth.jpg)
    - Fossil fuels have brought billions out of poverty with the opportunity for prosperity.
        - Thanks to cost-effective energy (mostly fossil fuel), extreme poverty has plummeted to <10% from 42% in 1980.[^10]

- Most of the world’s 8 billion people lack the energy they need to flourish.
    - The vast majority of the world needs much more energy to get out of poverty.
        - 3 billion people use less electricity than an American refrigerator.
        - 1/3 of the world uses wood and animal dung for heating and cooking.[^11]
        ![Clean cooking and heating](/img/art-b-33-of-the-world-uses-wood-and-dung.png)
    - Even in America, millions cannot afford enough energy.
        - Almost 1 in 3 American households say they’ve gone without food or medicine to pay for energy.
        - 1 in 5 of American households say they’ve kept their home at an unsafe temperature due to energy costs.[^12]
    - The massive need for energy can only be satisfied if massive fossil fuel use continues and expands.
        - Without fossil fuels, billions of energy-starved people plunge into poverty and early death.
        - With fossil fuels, billions more people can have the opportunity to flourish.
