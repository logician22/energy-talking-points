_The media are using Hurricane Idalia to spread the false narrative that fossil fuels make extreme weather danger worse._

_In reality,_ **_fossil fuels make us safer from extreme weather._**

_Here are answers to the media's top 25 extreme weather myths._[^1]
![Biden says climate criris is undeniable after Hurricane Idalia damage](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553ca8c3-6ff0-4a71-a0ed-bba19a670908_1600x900.png)

-   Myth 1: The world is experiencing unprecedented danger from extreme weather thanks to fossil fuels.  
      
    Truth: The world is experiencing unprecedented **safety** from extreme weather thanks to FFs—because FFs' **climate mastery benefits** overwhelm any negative climate side-effects.[^2]![Atmospheric CO2 vs Climate-related disaster deaths](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7798f29-e54a-491b-9d2f-828da7147f85_1412x900.png)
    
-   **Myth 2:** The **media and its designated experts are accurately reporting** on fossil fuels and extreme weather.  
      
    **Truth:** The media and its “experts” are:  
    **1. totally ignoring how fossil fuels make us safer than ever from extreme weather**  
    **2. wildly overstating fossil fuels' negative impact on weather.**
    
-   **Myth 3:** The **effect of fossil fuels** on extreme weather danger is **solely negative**.  
      
    Truth: Not only can **warming from fossil fuels have significant benefits** (fewer cold deaths) but the **low-cost energy fossil fuels provide for billions gives us an unprecedented ability to master extreme weather**.
    
-   Fossil fuels have made us far safer from extreme weather by providing low-cost energy for the amazing machines that protect us against storms, protect us against extreme temperatures, and alleviate drought. **Deaths from extreme weather have decreased 98% over the last century!**[^3]![Atmospheric CO2 vs Climate-related disaster deaths](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F092df70d-b6cb-491f-b3a6-8b62e052fe73_1412x900.png)
    
-   **Myth 4:** We don't need fossil fuels to protect ourselves from extreme weather—we can **just use alternatives**.  
      
    **Truth:** As **Europe is illustrating**, there is **no near-term replacement for fossil fuels** for the 1/4 of the world that uses abundant energy—let alone the 3/4 of the world that doesn't.[^4]
    
-   Fossil fuels will for decades remain uniquely able to provide low-cost, reliable energy to billions. That's **why fossil fuels are 80% of world energy and still growing**.  
      
    **Restricting fossil fuel use means far less energy for climate mastery activities such as heating, cooling, and irrigation.**[^5]![Electricity production sources](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e726280-7b30-4cfe-8633-b1deb5665b49_3054x1991.png)
    
-   **Myth 5:** The media and its designated experts are **accurately reporting the scientific linking of fossil fuel use and hurricanes**.  
      
    Truth: This **“reporting” is riddled with**  
    **1. deliberate misrepresentations** (e.g., hurricane frequency)  
    **2. biases** (e.g., only reporting negative links)
    
-   **Myth 6:** Media **claims about increasing hurricane frequency are accurate**.  
      
    **Truth:** Leading media outlets have **deliberately misrepresented the flat long-term hurricane trend**. E.g., the New York Times **cherry-picking a starting point—the low point of 1980—to make a flat trend seem upward**.[^6]![Category 4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes since 1980](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925b9145-eba3-47d9-8825-ce50dfca2589_1600x900.png)

-   Leading media outlets have also **deliberately ignored statements** by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about **how any increases in hurricane frequency in records are likely due to increasing reporting**, not actual frequency.[^7]![Global warming and hurricanes](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd8675b7-0c3d-497f-b28f-4dbd9ea5e5e1_1600x900.png)
    
-   Here are the **latest data on global hurricane frequency and intensity from a 2022 paper** (Klotzbach et al). **Does this remotely resemble what trusted media sources tell you?**[^8]![Global Cat 4-5 Hurricanes Klotzbach el al.

-   Here's **recent US data for landfalling hurricanes**, both overall and major. Again, consuming the New York Times and other trusted sources would you have any idea that the data looked like this?[^9]![Continental US Landfalling Hurricanes](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbccbc7e2-0c72-4a51-baba-e195933d9c6e_702x1024.png)
    
-   **Myth 7:** **Hurricanes are expected to get more frequent** as temperatures rise.  
      
    **Truth:** Mainstream science expects that **hurricanes will become less frequent as temperatures rise**.[^10]
![Hurricanes will become less frequent as temperatures rise](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95ed427e-fdb4-44b3-a29c-1fcdf09ec47a_1954x1008.png)
    
-   **Myth 8:** **Hurricane intensity is expected to get catastrophically higher** as temperatures rise.  
      
    **Truth:** Mainstream estimates say **hurricanes will be less frequent and between 1-10% more intense**. This is **not at all catastrophic** if we continue our fossil-fueled climate mastery.[^11]![Tropical cyclone intensities globally are projected to increase](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff00c2cde-3145-40cb-85d5-42c3498afadf_1954x1008.png)
    
-   **Myth 9: Media-cited research on extreme weather is unbiased.**  
      
    **Truth:** Extreme weather research is **riddled with biases**. In addition to **ignoring fossil-fueled climate mastery**, many researchers have **overtly political motives and ignore positive impacts of fossil fuels on weather**.
    
-   **Myth 10:** Climate researchers have **no political bias**.  
      
    **Truth:** Certain climate attribution “scientists” **admit that they are motivated by political goals and shape their “science” accordingly**. E.g., media favorite Friederike Otto wants **climate research “on the offensive.”**[^12]![Friederike Otto wants **climate research “on the offensive.”](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938a2e35-c060-4ff9-aa44-2fd2b7c45ea8_1600x900.png)
    
-   **Myth 11:** Extreme weather “attribution” researchers are **simply trying to understand extreme weather and have found fossil fuels guilty**.  
      
    **Truth:** Extreme weather **“attribution” only looks for negative impacts of fossil fuels on extreme weather**, brazenly ignoring any avoided negative impacts.
    
-   One of the few climate researchers who is openly looking at the full impact of fossil-fueled climate change, including potential avoided damage, is **meteorologist and hurricane expert Dr. Ryan Maue. What are the chances we see his point about avoided hurricanes in the mainstream news?**
    ![Dr. Ryan Maue. tweet](/img/tweet-ryan.png)
    
-   **Myth 12: Attributions of X% of an extreme weather event to humans are credible.**  
      
    **Truth:** Not only are many attributors clearly biased, but **no precise estimate of this kind is possible given today’s climate modeling limits**, where **mainstream models hugely diverge** from one another.[^13]![Climate models vs observations of the tropical troposphere](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84cfda82-474f-483e-8082-fe9c4ee262d5_3054x1991.png)
    
-   **Myth 13:** Fossil fuels **made Hurricane Idalia worse for Florida**.  
      
    **Truth:** While we **can’t know exactly how Idalia was different because of human climate impacts**, we **know that without fossil fuels Florida would be a third-world place that Idalia would have utterly devastated**.
    
-   We **also don't know how many hurricanes the US East Coast and other vulnerable spots dodged or will avoid thanks to global warming**. Models cannot give us this information and since it's not a negative, no mainstream and public researcher in the field is looking for ways to find out.
    
-   **Myth 14:** Thanks to fossil fuels **more people are dying from extreme weather**.  
      
    **Truth:** **Thanks to fossil fuels more people are not dying from extreme weather—and everything else**. Fossil-fueled prosperity has driven climate disaster deaths down 98% and life expectancy up by decades.[^14]
    
-   **Myth 15:** Thanks to fossil fuels we are **suffering overwhelming damage from extreme weather**.  
      
    **Truth:** The **trend of real weather damage is flat—despite many factors increasing vulnerability**, like increasing coastal populations and bad incentives from government bailout policies.[^15]![GlobalWeather Losses vs Percent of Global GDP: 1990-2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d4f246a-7b78-4eda-8293-d680513dbed5_1144x558.png)
    
-   **3 keys to understanding climate damage statistics:**  
    **1. Damage should be measured percentage of GDP** not compared dollar-for-dollar to a poorer past with less wealth at risk. (E.g., Miami Beach)  
    **2. More people today choose to live in damage-prone areas.**  
    **3. Government bailout policies increase damage.**![Michael Shellenberger Tweet](/img/michael-shellenberger-tweet.png)
    
-   **Myth 16:** **Extreme temperatures are a bigger danger than ever thanks to fossil fuels.**  
      
    **Truth: Extreme temperatures are a smaller danger than ever thanks to fossil-fueled heating and A/C**—plus the **net-benefits of warming in a world where far more people die of cold than heat**.[^16]![Heat and cold related deaths, 2000-2019, as a percentage of All Global Deaths](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a8712d0-8672-46f6-af57-1b898e188753_1720x1120.jpeg)
    
-   **Myth 17: Storms are a bigger danger than ever thanks to fossil fuels.**  
      
    **Truth: Storms are a smaller danger than ever** thanks to the **fossil-fueled machines that build sturdy buildings, as well as fossil-fueled weather warning systems and fossil-fueled disaster relief efforts**.[^17]![Atmospheric CO2 and Death rate from storms](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7513ede7-f403-4e18-8bed-860037ee8546_1600x1043.png)
    
-   **Myth 18: Drought is a bigger danger than ever thanks to fossil fuels.**  
      
    **Truth: Drought is a smaller danger than ever thanks to fossil-fueled irrigation, crop transport, and agriculture.** With more such mastery our crop productivity can continue to improve.[^18]![Atmospheric CO2 and Death rate from drought](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd76a19a7-c3eb-4324-b21c-ca8feed331f3_1600x900.png)
    
-   **Myth 19: Floods are a bigger danger than ever thanks to fossil fuels.**  
      
    **Truth: Floods are a smaller danger than ever thanks to fossil-fueled flood control infrastructure and disaster relief.**[^19]![World death rate from floods and G7 death rate from floods](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229c0bb9-d7d3-4b45-95e7-13522cfed9b0_1600x900.png)
    
-   **Myth 20:** **The rich, fossil-fueled world has ruined the poor world by making them vulnerable** to extreme weather.  
      
    **Truth: Fossil fuels have made everyone more prosperous and less vulnerable** to extreme weather.  
    **To be even better off the poor world needs more fossil fuels!**[^20]![World death rate from storms and G7 death rate from storms](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5fa9474-fa4d-40b2-ad2c-7d61b1edd97d_1600x900.png)
    
-   **Myth 21: We can expect fossil fuels to make extreme weather far more dangerous in the future.**  
      
    **Truth:** Fossil fuels’ climate mastery **benefits have far overwhelmed any negative side-effects on extreme weather for 100+ years** and there’s **every reason to expect this to continue**.[^21]
    
-   **Myth 22: Rapidly eliminating fossil fuels will make us safer from climate disasters.**  
      
    **Truth: Fossil fuels provide uniquely cost-effective energy** in a world that needs far more energy. **Rapidly eliminating fossil fuels means far less energy, which means catastrophic climate impotence—and mass death.**[^22]
    
-   **Myth 23: Fossil fuel use made Idalia far more damaging.**  
      
    **Truth: Idalia would be far more dangerous without fossil fuel use.**  
      
    Further, the role of rising CO2 levels in any given storm is highly speculative, leading scientists predict only modestly more powerful (and less frequent) storms.
    
-   Commentators try to claim a scientific connection between hurricanes and climate change because these storms are so impactful and could help their political agenda. But hurricanes are a particularly bad example because empirical science doesn't show a danger increase so far.[^23]![NOAA: Global warming and hurricanes](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b96facf-07a2-408f-b140-4bb51ed61d58_1600x900.png)
    
-   While leading scientists say that future hurricanes can become slightly stronger and less frequent, there is little evidence today of strong influence from warming so far. In any case, **what we face is a level of danger that we can readily master—if we can use fossil fuels**.
    
-   **Commentators treating speculation about hurricanes being more dangerous right now due to climate change as fact are dishonest.** How destructive a hurricane is today is mostly a function of the path it takes and the area's preparedness. Gladly, Florida seems to have avoided deaths.
    

-   **Myth 24:** When a major storm hits, **politicians like Governor Ron DeSantis should commit to anti-fossil-fuel policies**.  
      
    **Truth:** That would be **pseudoscientific symbolism**, and would **make their constituents poorer and more vulnerable going forward**. **Like Europe, which is now afraid of winter.**
    
-   It is absolutely **shameful that the political opponents of Governor DeSantis are trying to blame him for the damage of Hurricane Idalia** given that 1) the pro-freedom, pro-energy **policies he supports lessened the damage** and 2) his focus now is where it should be: hastening recovery.[^24]![MSNBC: Ron DeSantis denied human-caused climate change](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef77f089-f08b-4bea-aef5-1ee2b0d8690e_1600x900.png)
    
-   **Myth 25: The next extreme weather event you hear about would have been much better if we had rapidly eliminated fossil fuels.**  
      
    **Truth: We will be far safer from that event thanks to fossil fuels. And we are also alive with our current life expectancy thanks to fossil fuels.**

[^14]: For every million people on earth, annual deaths from climate-related causes (extreme temperature, drought, flood, storms, wildfires) declined 98%--from an average of 247 per year during the 1920s to 2.5 per year during the 2010s.

    Data on disaster deaths come from EM-DAT, CRED / UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium – www.emdat.be (D. Guha-Sapir).

    Population estimates for the 1920s from the [Maddison Database 2010](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-database-2010) come from the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Groningen. For years not shown, the population is assumed to have grown at a steady rate.

    Population estimates for the 2010s come from [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL).
