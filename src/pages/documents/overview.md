  Energy policy, including climate policy, will be one of the main issues of the
  2020 elections.


  I believe that the best policy for America’s future and the world’s future is a policy of energy freedom, in which all sources of energy--including fossil fuels--can compete to produce the most reliable, lowest-cost energy for billions of people.

I am extremely worried that a large percentage of candidates running for office are advocating “renewables only” policies that, if actually implemented, would quickly turn America into a third-world country.

I want to use my years of experience studying energy and persuading people about energy to help pro-freedom, pro-energy candidates and citizens as much as I can.

Thus, I will be sharing what I think are the best talking points, along with references, on every major energy and environmental issue this election.
