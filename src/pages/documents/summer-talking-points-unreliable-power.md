_This is Part 2 of a 4 part feature where I cover 4 of the top energy issues that will be discussed this summer, especially as politicians return home for August Recess._

**Don’t blame the climate for unreliable power, blame climate policies that shut down reliable power.**

- In recent summers it’s become commonplace for Americans to experience electricity shortages, with **calls to use less electricity and the frequent threat of brownouts or blackouts.**

    This is an embarrassment, and it was **totally preventable.**[^1]

- Anti-fossil-fuel politicians will blame our grid’s reliability problems on “climate change,” which is supposedly making it too hot for a grid to operate.

    This is absurd; **countries with much hotter temperatures than ours, like Singapore, are easily able to have a reliable grid.**[^2]

- **The real cause of reliable problems is the obvious: government-dictated “green energy” policies** that punish reliable fossil fuels and nuclear, while privileging unreliable solar and wind.

- Since at any given time **solar and wind can go near zero, using them to replace reliable power doesn’t work.** E.g., during February 2021’s winter storm, TX solar and wind were totally out to lunch—but they’d taken tens of $billions that could have gone to reliable, resilient power.[^3]

- **The Biden-Harris EPA has been at war with reliable power plants,** above all the coal plants that our grid depends on for 1/6th of its reliable power.

    And they’re doing this **while demand for power is increasing** from data centers and EVs.

- The Biden-Harris EPA’s recent power plant rules will not only **shut down vital coal power plants more quickly**, they will also **prevent new natural gas plants from replacing them.**
