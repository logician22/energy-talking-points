**Next week, the UN votes on an ocean carbon tax that would spike the price of food, fuel, and everyday essentials—hitting America the hardest.**

**Here’s what the administration and Congress can do to stop this in its tracks.**[^1]
    ![IMO Shipping Emissions Levy](/img/earth-org-imo-fuel-policy.png)

- The UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) is supposed to ensure safe shipping around the world.

    Instead, it’s **pushing a carbon tax on shipping fuel, with proposals ranging from $19 to $150/ton of CO2**—the equivalent of adding $1.29 to the price of gasoline![^2]

- **A $150/ton carbon tax on shipping would double fuel costs for large ships.**

    The marine fuel oil used to power most large ships costs ~$400/ton. Since burning one ton of marine fuel oil produces ~3.2 tons of CO2, a $150/ton carbon tax adds ~$480/ton—roughly doubling today’s price.[^3]

- Higher fuel costs from an ocean carbon tax would in turn **spike the price of essential goods like food, fuel, and clothing worldwide.** Since these goods are largely shipped by sea, 2x higher marine fuel costs mean higher shipping expenses that are passed directly to consumers.

- Since the US is the world’s largest importer of goods, with $3.2 trillion in imports including $760 billion for consumer goods per year, **an ocean carbon tax would disproportionately raise prices for US consumers and businesses.**

    An ocean carbon tax is a tax on America most of all.[^4]

- **The idea of a maritime carbon tax originates in the “2023 GHG IMO Strategy,” a Biden-backed document that commits UN members to a goal of net-zero international shipping emissions by 2050.**

    The Trump administration must not allow this Biden climate policy to quietly take effect.[^5]

- **How the state department can stop the ocean carbon tax**

    The state department, led by Marco Rubio, can **formally withdraw US support for the “2023 IMO GHG Strategy,” vote NO on the ocean carbon tax to at next week’s IMO meeting—and urge our allies to follow suit.**

- **How the EPA and the Coast Guard can stop the ocean carbon tax**

    The EPA, led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, and the Coast Guard, led by Admiral Kevin Lunday, can **prohibit their agencies from enforcing any international or global carbon tax unless explicitly ratified by the US Senate.**

- **How the Senate can stop the ocean carbon tax**

    The Senate, including Majority Leader John Thune and Energy Chairman Mike Lee, can make clear that it **considers the US signing an ocean carbon tax a treaty-level decision that requires Senate confirmation, which will not be forthcoming.**

- Recent reports indicate that the EU may push to replace the ocean carbon tax with a cap-and-trade system.

    While marginally less damaging, this policy would still be toxic for America and the global economy, and the US should vehemently oppose it.[^6]
