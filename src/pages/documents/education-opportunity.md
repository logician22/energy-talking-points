  pro-fossil-fuel, pro-freedom energy policies.

***Today’s energy crisis has proved that our anti-fossil-fuel, anti-freedom energy policies are destructive.***

***Now is the perfect time to educate the world about the need for pro-fossil-fuel, pro-freedom policies.***

Here’s why I believe this, and what we can do to take advantage of this opportunity.

- ​​For the past 15+ years, **thought leaders have told us that their attacks on the freedom to invest in, produce, and transport fossil fuels wouldn’t cause problems**, because solar + wind could rapidly replace fossil fuels.

    **[Reality has proven them wrong.](https://alexepstein.substack.com/p/talking-points-on-skyrocketing-natural)**[^1]

- For the past 15 years, I and a handful of other **pro-human energy/environmental thinkers have been publicly arguing that anti-fossil-fuel, anti-freedom energy policies would cause skyrocketing prices and huge reliability problems**.

    **Reality has proven us right.**

- Until recently, most people did not take seriously the threat of anti-fossil-fuel, anti-freedom energy policies because the **possibility of an energy crisis seemed remote—some artifact of the 1970s**. Now that we are **in a crisis, many people are open to the truth about energy**.

- A global energy crisis clearly caused by our thought leaders makes this a **perfect moment to educate the public** that:

    **1) The world needs more fossil fuels.**\
    **2) The world needs more energy freedom.**\
    **3) This will lead not to climate crisis but continuing climate mastery.** (see image)

- Recent years have shown that **the public is receptive to big-picture, pro-human arguments for fossil fuel use and energy freedom, and against climate catastrophism**. For example, I, Michael Shellenberger, Bjorn Lomborg, and Steve Koonin have had **major bestsellers to this effect**.

- Despite a huge opportunity to argue for fossil fuels and energy freedom, **many traditional fossil fuel supporters are seizing defeat from the jaws of victory** by **supporting new anti-fossil fuel policies**. E.g., leading oil companies and Republicans are now pushing big carbon taxes![^2]

- Despite a **huge opportunity to discredit the anti-fossil-fuel, anti-freedom thought leaders who caused today’s energy crisis**, these people and institutions are being mostly let off the hook. E.g., the World Economic Forum and all the green nonprofits are still considered credible.[^3]

- One key element of re-educating the world about energy is to put forward a **vision of global human flourishing through global human empowerment**—including empowerment of the energy-poor, such as the 3 billion individuals who use less electricity than a typical American refrigerator.

- Another key element of re-educating the world about energy is to put forward a **positive energy freedom platform**. Mine includes:

    **Ending preferences for unreliable electricity.**
    **Decriminalizing nuclear.**
    **Liberating responsible development.**

- Another key element of re-educating the world about energy is **discrediting today’s anti-fossil fuel thought leaders**, by pointing out that they have consistently ignored the enormous benefits of fossil fuels and catastrophized their side-effects.

- To leverage today’s unprecedented opportunity to re-educate the world about energy, we need **highly persuasive resources** that put forward a positive energy vision+platform, while discrediting today’s thought leaders.

    I have created two: [Energy Talking Points](https://energytalkingpoints.com/) and ***[Fossil Future](https://www.amazon.com/Fossil-Future-Flourishing-Requires-Gas-Not-ebook/dp/B098M3Y7VC?&tag=thoughtful0f-20)***.

- The **[EnergyTalkingPoints.com](https://energytalkingpoints.com/) website and my [Energy Talking Points newsletter](https://alexepstein.substack.com/)** deliver powerful, concise, well-referenced talking points on energy, environmental, and climate issues. All are **free**. **Please take advantage of them**.

- My book ***Fossil Future***, **now available online and in bookstores, is the ultimate energy education resource**. Written for people who expect to disagree with it, it begins by totally discrediting today’s thought leaders, then systematically explores our energy future from a pro-human perspective.

- I sent out 100s of advance copies of ***Fossil Future*** so that **other people, not me, can tell you how uniquely good it is at re-educating people about energy**—as one reader wrote “**It’s really that good and I promise you’ll think about energy very differently.**” Here are some of the many endorsements so far.\
    [https://alexepstein.substack.com/p/endorsements-for-fossil-future](https://alexepstein.substack.com/p/endorsements-for-fossil-future)

- **The Washington Post and other anti-fossil fuel institutions have tried to cancel** ***Fossil Future***, because they are afraid of my ultra-logical, ultra-pro-science refutation of their views—and the attention it is getting.

    **They are right to be afraid**.\
    [https://alexepstein.substack.com/p/how-i-stopped-the-washington-post](https://alexepstein.substack.com/p/how-i-stopped-the-washington-post)

- **2 weeks before its 5/24 release,** ***Fossil Future*** **has already sold enough copies to make the NYT bestseller list** (NYT bias may prevent it) and will likely sell out before release day. That’s despite an unusually large first printing.

    **This is great news for energy education**.

- If ***Fossil Future*** becomes an **unavoidable blockbuster, the anti-fossil fuel establishment will be forced to respond to me—or be embarrassed. And if they respond, they will embarrassed**, because climate catastrophism is provably false and fossil fuel elimination is provably immoral.

- Paraphrasing Victor Hugo, **nothing can resist an idea whose time has come**.

    **The moral case for a fossil future is an idea whose time has come**.

    **Fossil Future has been published, a massive energy education of the world begins**.
