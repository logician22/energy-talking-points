description: The Paris Climate Accords are ineffective and asymmetrical, and will prove hugely costly for the United States, while achieving negligible environmental impact. Reentering them is a huge mistake.

#### Q: Don't fossil fuels get more subsidies than solar and wind?

**A: Not only do solar and wind get dozens of times more subsidies than fossil fuels, they get many other unfair advantages--such as no price penalty for unreliability--without which they would barely be used at all.**

1. The proper way to measure energy subsidies is: How much taxpayer money does the government pay per unit of energy? Every per-unit analysis using data from the US Energy Information Administration is clear: solar and wind get *dozens of times* more subsidies than fossil fuels.[^1]
2. Claims that fossil fuels get more subsidies than solar/wind use "total subsidies," not per-unit subsidies. By that logic Walmart is more expensive than Nordstrom because Walmart takes in more total $. (No store, including Nordstrom, charges the crazy markup that solar/wind get.)
3. A comprehensive analysis of federal subsidies per unit of electricity generated from 2010-2019 found that solar got 211 times more subsidies than natural gas and wind got 48 times more subsidies than natural gas.[^2]
4. In addition to exorbitant subsidies solar and wind get numerous other unfair advantages, including:

    * Mandates that force us to pay for solar panels, wind turbines, and long-distance transmission lines, regardless of cost[^3]
    * No price penalty for solar/wind's costly unreliability

5. Claims that fossil fuels get trillions in "negative externalities," mostly from climate impacts, are bogus because 1) climate deaths are at record lows--as are climate damages as a %age of wealth; 2) they ignore countless trillions in positive externalities from fossil fuels.[^4]
6. One huge category of positive externality from fossil fuels is the amount of *time* that uniquely low-cost, reliable, versatile, scalable fossil fuel "machine labor" frees up from tasks like farming. Freed-up time underlies all innovation, from the Internet to Covid-19 vaccines.
