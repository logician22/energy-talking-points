**The false idea that fossil fuels’ climate impacts are an “emergency” that requires us to rapidly eliminate fossil fuels has caused an energy emergency.**

**The “climate emergency” movement must be held accountable.**

- The world is experiencing the **worst energy crisis since the 1970s**, and it may end up being far worse.

    Skyrocketing **energy prices are driving price inflation in every area** of life. **Even in wealthy Europe** we are seeing **mass-hardship, deindustrialization, and fear of winter**.[^1]

- While America is suffering from the energy crisis and Europe is suffering far more, the **worst-affected are poor nations**—who are getting outbid for today’s scarce energy supplies. For example, we’ve seen power outages in Bangladesh, which has been outbid for natural gas by Europe.[^2]

- The global energy crisis constitutes an emergency—**a dire and deadly problem requiring a swift, dramatic solution**.

    What’s the solution to the global energy emergency?

    We must **put a stop to its cause: the “climate emergency” movement’s campaign to rapidly eliminate fossil fuels**.

- While **“climate change”—humans impacting climate—is real, “climate emergency” is not**. The **world is slowly becoming warmer—at a cold point in geological history**, when many more people die of cold than of heat. This **doesn’t at all justify rapidly restricting global fossil fuel use**.[^3]

- The truth is that **fossil fuels’ CO2 emissions have contributed to the warming of the last 170 years**, but that warming has been **mild—1° C, mostly in the colder parts of the world**. And life on Earth thrived (and was far greener) when CO2 levels were at least 5X higher than today’s.[^4]

- **Fossil fuels actually overall make us far safer from climate** by providing low-cost energy for the amazing machines that protect us against storms, protect us against extreme temperatures, and alleviate drought. **Climate disaster deaths have decreased 98% over the last century**.[^5]

- **Even the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change** (IPCC), which has a history of catastrophizing fossil fuels’ climate impacts and ignoring their climate benefits, **contemplates no scenario in which overall well-being declines due to climate change**.[^6]
    ![SSPs](/img/carbon-brief-ssps.png)

- The **only rational approach to reducing fossil fuels’ CO2 emissions** is a **long-term** one based on **liberating low-carbon innovation**.

    That will lead to the development of truly globally cost-competitive alternatives—most promisingly, low-cost, global-scale nuclear energy.[^7]

- Unfortunately, instead of recognizing that CO2 emissions are not an emergency and pursuing a long-term emissions-reduction policy of liberating low-carbon alternatives, **our leaders declared “emergency” and started immediately restricting fossil fuels—with no viable replacement**.

- The “climate emergency” movement, centered in the West, has restricted
    **1) fossil fuel investment**
    **2) fossil fuel production**
    **3) fossil fuel transport**

    **This has artificially suppressed fossil fuel supply, making industry unable to meet growing demand**. Which means sky-high prices.

- **Suppressing fossil fuel investment**

    For fossil fuel energy to remain low-cost requires sufficient investment. But the “climate emergency” movement has **used government and private entities, often under the banner of “ESG,” to punish and suppress it**—meaning less fossil fuel supply.

- Is it any wonder that, threatened with punishment, investment in oil and gas declined dramatically? **Between 2011 and 2021, oil and gas exploration investments declined by 50%**.

    Less investment = less supply = higher prices.[^8]

- **Suppressing fossil fuel production**

    For fossil fuel energy to remain low-cost for billions of people requires that producers be free to produce it all around the world.

    The “climate emergency” movement has **opposed it throughout the world, often successfully, increasing prices**.[^9]

- The “climate emergency” movement **pushed France, Germany, the UK, Bulgaria, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, and The Netherlands to place preemptive bans on fracking**—the source of bounteous oil and gas production in the US.[^10]

- **Suppressing fossil fuel transport**

    For fossil fuels to remain low-cost for billions of people we need to be able to easily transport them from where they are produced to where they are used. But **the “climate emergency” movement has opposed transportation around the world**.[^11]

- In the US, **opposition to natural gas pipelines and LNG terminals has prevented us from offering cheap gas throughout the country and around the world**. In Canada, home of staggering oil deposits, pipeline restrictions have limited their ability to bring oil to market.[^12]

- Consider the fate of the **Keystone XL pipeline**, which would have matched abundant, reliable Canadian heavy crude with US Gulf refining capacity. **After over a decade of delays, Biden finally killed it**. This **made us and our allies more vulnerable to OPEC+**.[^13]

- The “climate emergency” movement has rationalized its opposition to fossil fuel investment, production, and transport with **claims that solar and wind could rapidly replace fossil fuels**.

    This has obviously not happened. Despite huge solar and wind subsidies **fossil fuel demand has increased**.

- There was never any reason to expect solar and wind to replace fossil fuels. **The world needs far more energy**—3 billion people still use less electricity than a US refrigerator—so there’s **no reason to expect lower demand for any form of cost-effective energy**, let alone ultra-versatile fossil fuels.[^14]

- **Solar and wind’s basic problem is unreliability**, to the point they can go near zero at any time. Thus they **don’t replace reliable power, they parasite on it**. This is why they need huge subsidies and why no grid is near 50% solar or wind without huge parasitism on reliable neighbors.[^15]

- The “climate emergency” movement successfully perpetrated **two deceptions on the world**

    **1. we needed immediate, drastic action against fossil fuels.**

    **2. unreliable solar and wind would save us from adverse consequences.**

    The cost of these deceptions has been a global energy emergency.

- The “climate emergency” movement is **trying to deny all responsibility for today’s energy emergency**.

    They blame the emergency on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—which is a secondary factor. Or, they chastise the fossil fuel industry for not meeting demand—which is absurd and unjust.

- **Today’s high fossil fuel prices are not primarily a “Putin price hike.”**

    They are caused by global anti-fossil-fuel “climate emergency” policies—which made fossil fuel prices artificially high before Putin’s war and prevented the free world from quickly increasing production in response.[^16]

- The “climate emergency” movement **has the gall to chastise the fossil fuel industry for not sufficiently ramping up production** post-pandemic and post-Putin-invasion. But this insufficient ramp-up is the **result of anti-fossil-fuel policies that restrict and punish new attempted production!**

- Scary fact: the **“climate emergency” movement has caused an energy emergency just by achieving a tiny fraction of its goals**. While it has advocated rapidly reducing fossil fuel use, it has only succeeded globally at **slowing the growth of fossil fuel use**.

    And **even that is catastrophic**.

- If just restricting the growth of fossil fuels in a world that needs far more energy is catastrophic, **what would it mean to reduce CO2 emissions by the 50% many “climate emergency” advocates want by 2030** and the 100% they want by 2050?

    **Global misery and premature death.**

- **Summary: the cause of today’s global energy emergency is the “climate emergency” movement restricting the supply of desperately-needed fossil fuels in the name of 1) the false idea that climate impact = emergency 2) the nonexistent ability of solar and wind to rapidly replace fossil fuels.**

- The **solution** to the global energy emergency is to **reject the “climate emergency” movement and embrace the freedom to use all forms of energy.**

    This will:
    **1) Ensure plenty of energy going forward.**
    **2) Maximize the speed of at which truly cost-competitive alternatives are deployed.**
