_This is the second of 11 “Alex Notes” on my book [Fossil Future](https://www.amazon.com/Fossil-Future-Flourishing-Requires-Gas-Not/dp/0593420411/?tag=thoughtful0f-20)—like Cliff’s Notes, but actually written by the author. [(Read the first one here.)](https://energytalkingpoints.com/how-our-knowledge-system-ignores-the-benefits-of-fossil-fuels/)_

_(Also, for those who preordered Fossil Future or who are premium subscribers to this newsletter, I’m doing a special live event “How to talk to anyone about climate change” on October 23. The invite will come to you later this week.)_

**The mainstream “knowledge system” has an unrepentant track-record of catastrophizing the side-effects of fossil fuels: wildly overpredicting negative side-effects and ignoring our ability to master them.**

**(A summary of** ***Fossil Future,*** **Chapter 2)**

- Not only does **our “knowledge system”**—the people and institutions we rely upon to research, synthesize, disseminate, and evaluate expert knowledge—consistently ignore the massive benefits of fossil fuels, it also **consistently catastrophizes the side-effects of fossil fuels.**

- **Our Knowledge System’s Real Track Record on Climate: 180 Degrees Wrong**

    The mainstream knowledge system has predicted far faster warming than has occurred, and has predicted a massive increase in climate-related disaster deaths when these deaths have dramatically decreased.[^1]

- **In 1989, AP News reported** climate predictions from New York office director of the UN Environmental Programme, Noel Brown, including **that “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.”**[^2]

- **The Error of Catastrophizing**

    The 180-degree wrong prediction of increasing climate-related disaster deaths was the result of the error of catastrophizing, which consists of:

    **1) dramatically overstating a negative side-effect**\
    **2) ignoring our ability to master that side-effect**

- **The “Expert” Prediction of Rapid Catastrophic Global Cooling**

    Our knowledge system, before it publicized predictions of rapid/deadly global warming, publicized designated expert predictions of rapid/deadly global cooling—in both cases in contradiction to most experts’ views.

- Many of the same trusted news institutions that today are warning us about catastrophic global warming—e.g., _The Guardian, The New York Times, Newsweek_—were in the 1970s warning us about catastrophic global cooling![^3]

- **Catastrophizing Resources**

    **Our knowledge system has a track record of catastrophizing resource availability—**predicting catastrophic resource depletion of fossil fuels and other resources **when in fact fossil fuel machine labor produced unprecedented availability of all resources.**

- **“Expert” Paul Ehrlich catastrophizing resource availability in 1971:**

    **“By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people...** I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.”[^4]

- **Catastrophizing Environmental Quality**

    **Our knowledge system has a track record of catastrophizing environmental quality**—predicting unlivably bad air and water **when in reality human beings improved air quality,** including through reducing fossil fuels’ harmful emissions.

- **Designated expert Kenneth Watt catastrophizing environmental quality in 1970:**

    “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, **it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”**[^5]

- **Catastrophizing Nuclear Energy**

    **Our knowledge system has a track record of catastrophizing nuclear**—the most promising competitor to fossil fuels with side-effects that experts recognize as masterable—**revealing a broader pattern of catastrophizing cost-effective energy as such.**

- **Nuclear has been so successfully catastrophized by our knowledge system that it is virtually criminalized.**

    The extremely safe levels of radiation are treated as so dangerous and thus requiring so many costly “safety” requirements that cost-effective nuclear is almost impossible.

- **An Uncorrected Failure**

    Instead of acknowledging its track record of catastrophizing fossil fuels, the mainstream knowledge system has been unrepentant and in fact elevated the catastrophizing designated experts to new heights of influence.

- **According to designated expert Bill McKibben in 2009, “Every time we thought we understood something about climate, the truth has turned out to be worse than we thought.”**

    And seven years later, “The numbers on global warming are even scarier than we thought.”[^6]

- **Deadly Prescriptions**

    Our knowledge system’s proven, uncorrected willingness to ignore the massive benefits of fossil fuels and catastrophize side-effects means it is fully capable of prescribing the rapid elimination of fossil fuels even if this would be catastrophic.

- **In 1998, “expert” Bill McKibben endorsed a scenario of outlawing 60% of fossil fuel use to slow catastrophic climate change,** even though that would mean that each human would only get to produce enough CO2 to, in his words, “drive an average American car nine miles a day.”[^7]

- **Our Missing Protection**

    While in the past we were protected from calls for eliminating fossil fuels because our knowledge system significantly valued cost-effective energy, today’s knowledge system as a whole ignores fossil fuels’ benefits—meaning we have no such protection.

- **Fossil fuel elimination policies of going “net zero,” “fossil free,” and “100% renewable” were just a decade ago considered idealistic if not crackpot policies** most prominently advocated by Bill McKibben.

    **Today they are the dominant policy idea in most of the world.**

- **Understanding Both Our Knowledge System’s Energy Failure and Ours**

    To know the right path forward on fossil fuels we need to understand how our knowledge system has come to oppose cost-effective energy based on (irrationally) ignoring benefits and catastrophizing side-effects.
