_For four years now, ETP has had fun breaking down every imaginable energy, environmental, and climate issue down into brief, self-contained “talking points” that are easy to understand and share._

_Today, I am sharing a new, even shorter form of ETP: Energy Sound Bites._ ***The goal of Energy Sound Bites is to distill key facts and insights about energy, environmental, and climate issues into a form—100 characters or less—that’s short enough to remember and repeat whenever you need them.***

_I’ll start the Energy Sound Bites series with one of my favorite topics: the future of fossil fuels._

***At root, there are 3 core truths about the future of fossil fuels:***

    ![3 core truths about fossil fuels](/img/3-core-truths.jpg)

_Today, I’ll share some Energy Sound Bites to support the first core truth: We must think about fossil fuels in a balanced way._

### We must think about fossil fuels in a balanced way.

- Most “experts” look at the negatives of fossil fuels but ignore huge positives.

- Many “experts” ignore that much of the world would starve without fertilizer from natural gas.[^1]

- Many “experts” ignore that much of the world would starve without oil-powered agricultural machines.

- Fixating on the negatives and ignoring the positives of any technology is deadly.

- If we just looked at the negatives of antibiotics and ignored the positives, billions would die.

- To decide what to do about fossil fuels we must be balanced, looking at both negatives and positives.

- Fossil fuels do impact climate—but even there we must consider positives along with negatives.

- We can’t just look at how warming increases heat waves, we also must look at lives saved from cold.

- A huge, ignored climate positive we get from fossil fuels is the ability to master climate danger.

- Fossil fueled cooling allows us to dramatically reduce danger from heat.

- Fossil fueled heating allows us to dramatically reduce danger from cold.

- Fossil fueled irrigation allows us to dramatically reduce danger from drought.[^2]

- Fossil fueled evacuation systems allow us to dramatically reduce danger from storms.[^3]

- Fossil fueled climate mastery has helped us become safer than ever from climate.

- The climate death rate has decreased by 98% over the last century as fossil fuel use has risen.[^4]

- Sadly most “experts” ignore fossil fuels’ climate positives, including climate mastery.

- The IPCC’s 1000+ page climate reports ignore all the ways fossil fuels increase climate safety.

- In weighing fossil fuels’ positives and negatives, we must be precise—not exaggerate or fabricate.

- Sadly many “experts” exaggerate the negatives of fossil fuels in addition to ignoring the positives.

- Al Gore portrays 20 ft sea level rise as imminent when extreme UN projections are 3 ft / 100 years.[^5]

- If we carefully weigh fossil fuels’ positives and negatives, it becomes clear we need more of them.

***Next up:*** _Only by using fossil fuels can 8 billion people have the energy they need to survive and flourish._
