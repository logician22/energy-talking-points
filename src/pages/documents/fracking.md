  Fracking is one of the most important technologies in our economy and can be done very safely. Government should ban only dangerous misuses of fracking, not all fracking. A fracking ban is the fastest way to create a global recession and an American depression.

### Quick summary

1. Many politicians, including Joe Biden, support banning fracking--on federal lands or altogether. But fracking is required to produce over 60% of American oil and 75% of American natural gas. A frack ban is the single fastest way to create a global recession and an American depression.[^1] [^2]
2. Oil is the world’s leading source of energy because it provides low-cost, highly-concentrated energy for transportation. Oil provides 90% of the world’s transportation energy and has no scalable substitute for airplanes, cargo ships, and large agricultural equipment.[^3] [^4]
3. Fracking has taken us from a huge net importer of oil to a net exporter. In 2007, the US imported over 400 million gallons of oil per day. Last September, for the first time since records began in 1973, the US was a net oil exporter--a trend energy officials expect to continue.[^5] [^6]
4. A ban on fracking would take the same percentage of oil off the market as the 1973 Arab oil embargo did. That incident more than quadrupled oil prices and triggered a global recession. A smaller oil incident in 1979 also triggered a global recession.[^7]
5. Smart politicians know that restricting oil production = recession or worse. That’s why Barack Obama ran on ending “the tyranny of oil” but then ended the oil export ban and took credit for the fracking revolution: “America’s like the biggest oil producer…that was me, people.”[^8] [^9]
6. Fracking has added over 100 billion gallons of oil to annual oil production. And it has added even more energy in the form of natural gas--the equivalent of almost 200 billion gallons of oil a year![^10]
7. Between 2008 and 2018 fracking natural gas added 17 times more energy to the US than all solar panels and wind turbines combined. And that’s 100% reliable energy, unlike the unreliable energy from solar and wind that needs constant backup from...fracked natural gas.[^11]
8. Does fracking endanger groundwater? Fracking is one of the world’s safest industrial practices for groundwater because it takes place a mile below groundwater. The biggest threat to groundwater is Mother Nature, who contaminates it with methane, arsenic, uranium, and salt.[^12] [^13]
9. Fracking, like many industrial activities, creates small earth movements--not dangerous earthquakes. A typical frack job moves the ground less than a semi truck driving down the road.[^14]
10. Because fracking is so vital to our lives and can be done safely and responsibly, it would be insane and cruel to ban fracking. We should continue to ban only dangerous misuses of fracking and otherwise continue to enjoy the prosperity this wonderful technology brings us.

    In a [Democratic primary debate in March 2020](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/joe-biden-says-no-new-fracking-for-oil-and-gas) Joe Biden agreed to a radical “no new fracking” policy to attract Democratic voters. While most of the US unconventional oil and gas operations take place on private lands, even a federal policy banning new development would be a substantial hit on domestic energy production.\
    Joe Biden’s [energy plan](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) also calls for a net-zero CO2 emissions economy wide by no later than 2050. His [climate plan](https://joebiden.com/climate/) also promises aggressive new methane emission limits. Effectively, this amounts to a ban and early retirement of coal, gas, and oil for electricity generation ([over 60%](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) of the current total), as there is no cost-effective technology available to capture CO2 from fuel combustion, even though Biden tried to [backpedal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2020/07/11/joe-biden-tries-to-clean-up-his-fracking-problem-in-pennsylvania/) on the direct attacks against fracking recently.

    25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas can be converted into gallons of oil using energy [conversion factors](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/):\

    Between 2008, when the shale gas production took off, and 2018, US shale gas development produced an estimated total of 126,677 billion cubic feet or over 130,000 trillion Btu (using the [conversion factor](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/) 1 cubic foot of natural gas = 1,037 Btu).

    [U.S. Energy Information Administration - Shale Gas estimated production](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/NG_ENR_SHALEGAS_A_EPG0_R5302_BCF_A.htm)

    US electricity generation from solar and wind from 2008 to 2018 was 2,090,690 gigawatt hours or over 7,000 trillion Btu (using the [conversion factor](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/) 1 kilowatt hour of electricity = 3,412 Btu).

    This means shale gas production created about 18 times (or 1,800%) as much energy for the US as did solar and wind combined.
