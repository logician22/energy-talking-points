**_“Green energy” has 2 problems_**

_1)_ **_It’s not really energy: It doesn’t provide reliable energy_**

_2)_ **_It’s not really green: It has a huge “environmental impact”_**

_The goal of “green energy” is to_ **_pretend to support abundant energy_** _but to_ **_actually oppose it_**_._

-   The **“green energy” movement claims that it wants cost-effective energy**—affordable, reliable, plentiful—**just without fossil fuels’ pollution or GHG emissions**.  
      
    But this is **contradicted by its hostility toward clean, non-carbon nuclear and hydro**—the most proven alternatives to fossil fuels.
    
-   You might expect the “green energy” movement to be the #1 supporter of clean, non-carbon nuclear and hydroelectric energy, but instead, it is the #1 opponent. **“Green” groups have opposed nuclear for decades** (leading to crippling costs) and **worked to shut down hydroelectric dams**.
    
-   Why does the “green” movement oppose nuclear and hydro?  
      
    It is because “green” solar and wind are just so cost-effective and so “green”?  
      
    No. **Solar and wind have not proven to be cost-effective at all**, and in many ways, they are the least “green” form of energy.
    
-   **“Green energy” isn’t really energy**
      
    Calling solar and wind “green energy” makes them seem like other forms of energy, just “green.” But they’re not. **All other forms of energy provide reliable energy—real energy**—whereas solar and wind are unreliable parasites of reliable energy.
    
-   Despite **claims that solar and wind are rapidly replacing fossil fuels, they provide less than 5% of world energy**—only electricity, ⅕ of energy—and, crucially, even that small percentage **depends on huge subsidies and reliable (mostly fossil-fueled) power plants**.[^1]
    
-   **Solar and wind’s basic problem is unreliability**, to the point they can go near zero at any time. Thus **they don’t replace reliable power, they parasitize on it**. This is why they need huge subsidies and why no grid is near 50% solar and wind without huge parasitism on reliable neighbors.[^2]
    
-   The **popular idea that we can use mostly or only solar and wind with sufficient battery backup** is not being tried anywhere because it’s **economically absurd**. Batteries are so expensive that **just 3 days of global backup using Elon Musk’s Megapacks would cost $590 trillion**, about six times global GDP![^3]

    ## Refuting the myth that just a small area of solar panels plus storage can power the world
    [![Refuting the myth that just a small area of solar panels plus storage can power the world](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1300,h_650,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3b0181e-c268-4205-bd29-8d1c9f644576_1600x900.png)](https://energytalkingpoints.com/musk-myth/)
    
-   “Green” solar and wind may someday become a part of real energy solutions—if generators using solar and wind are willing to guarantee reliability, instead of generating unreliable power and forcing everyone else to clean up their mess. But **today's “green energy” is not real energy**.
    
-   **If solar and wind ever become truly cost-effective**, you can be certain of one thing: **the “green energy” movement will oppose them** as insufficiently “green” given their huge “environmental impacts.”
    
-   **“Green energy” isn’t really green**
      
    **If solar and wind became cost-effective** and deployed on a large scale, they would have a level of **“environmental impact” from mining and land use that would make the “green” movement oppose them**. In fact, this is already happening.
    
-   **“Green” means minimal or nonexistent “environmental impact.”**  
      
    Because **sunlight and wind are dilute sources of energy**—they **take up more space and use more of many materials** than fossil fuels or nuclear. This massive “environmental impact” is not at all “green.”[^4]
    
  
    
    ![Art_13](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb714444-e2c4-41fa-8eee-fbd5e6bff191_1920x1080.png)
    
-   Consider the land use requirements of solar. The world uses over 165,000 TWh of energy per year, which requires ~19 billion kW of power on average. An optimistic, real-world power density for solar projects is 10 Watts per square meter. **To power the world, you’d need ~1.8 million square kilometers of solar PV projects.**[^5]
    
-   If 1.8 million square kilometers of solar panels doesn’t seem like much, note that it is **more than all cities, towns, villages, and human infrastructure combined** (~1.5 million square kilometers). And this excludes the huge footprints of solar and battery mining, manufacturing, and transmission.[^6]
    
-   Consider the mining requirements of solar, wind, and batteries.  
      
    An **International Energy Agency projection for a “net zero” scenario** shows an increase in **mining and processing of minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel, and rare earths by 4,200%, 2,500%, 1,900%, and 700% by 2040**.[^7]
    
-   Note: The **mining and processing of various minerals** necessary to supply today's material-hungry solar, wind, and battery schemes are mostly **outsourced to China** and other developing countries because they would be **cost-prohibitive under Western “green” policies**.[^8]
    
 
    
    ![Chinese supply chain dominance](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1829700-bd81-46d2-90c1-8aca8590ec95_746x441.png)
    
-   Because “green energy” has so much environmental impact, **even on today’s small scale it faces huge “green” opposition to its land use, mining, and transmission-line-building** requirements. E.g., **the Biden administration recently shut down a prime “green energy” mining site in Minnesota**.[^9]
    
-   If “green” solar and wind aren’t really energy, and if they have so much environmental impact that the “green” movement opposes them in practice, then **why does the green movement so enthusiastically support them rhetorically?** To hide its **real goal: radically reducing energy use**.
    
-   **“Green”—“minimal human impact”—is a fundamentally anti-energy idea**. Energy is “the capacity to do work,” which means transforming—impacting—our environment. More energy use equals more impact. **If you don’t want us to impact Earth you ultimately must oppose every form of energy**.
    
-   The fundamental hostility of the **“green” movement** to energy explains why **throughout its history it has never supported current, cost-effective sources of energy** and only “supported” imaginary sources of energy that might exist in the future.
    
-   “Green” leaders supported nuclear—until it became cost-effective, at which point they demonized and criminalized it. “Green” leaders supported natural gas—until it became cost-effective on a global scale thanks to shale energy tech, at which point they demonized it as “fracking.”[^10]
    
-   Because the “green” movement is anti-energy, **any enthusiasm its leaders express for fusion is phony**; while they may claim to want clean, cheap, abundant energy before it exists, **they will not like the impact it has once it exists**. And in the past, green leaders admitted this.[^11]
    
-   **Amory Lovins**, the leader of the modern “green energy” movement, said in the 1970s: “If you ask me, **it'd be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap, abundant energy, because of what we would do with it**.”[^12]

-   When asked in 1989 about the prospect of fusion by the LA Times, **Jeremy Rifkin** said: “‘**It’s the worst thing that could happen to our planet.**’ Inexhaustible power, he argues, only **gives man an infinite ability to exhaust the planet’s resources**, to destroy its fragile balance…”[^13]
    
 
    
    ![Rifkin quote LA Times](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F940d8086-1a29-4df4-932d-6099c8be2b38_1600x900.png)
    
-   When asked in 1989 about the prospect of fusion by the LA Times, leading “green” thinker **Paul Ehrlich** said that given society’s dismal record in managing technology, the prospect of **cheap, inexhaustible power from fusion** is “**like giving a machine gun to an idiot child**.”[^14]
    
    
    
    ![Ehrlich quote LA Times](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F257e40d6-37b1-485e-a765-a7375c33090b_1600x900.png)
    
-   The world needs to **reject the “green” movement** and instead **embrace a “human flourishing” movement** that embraces intelligent human impact on Earth as a good thing, and that both embraces today’s most cost-effective energy sources—including [fossil fuels](https://twitter.com/AlexEpstein/status/1565007126107262976)—and is eager to improve on them.
    
-   To understand why fossil fuels are so valuable for the foreseeable future, and why their benefits far outweigh their negative side-effects including climate side-effects, read this summary of my book Fossil Future.
