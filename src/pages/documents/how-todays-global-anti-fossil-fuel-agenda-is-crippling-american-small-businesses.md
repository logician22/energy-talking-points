*Here is the written testimony I submitted.*

Because energy is a major input in every business, the lower cost and more reliable energy is, the lower cost and more reliable everything is. **The higher cost and less reliable energy is, the less efficient and less competitive US businesses, including small businesses, are**.

Today we're hearing how **irrational policies are crippling one crucial area of the energy business: offshore oil production**, which provides almost 1/6th of our domestic oil production—**production without which gasoline would be far more expensive and far, far less secure**.[^1]
What I would like to do today is put the irrational attack on offshore drilling in its broader context, which is that it is just a tiny piece of today's rabidly irrational global anti-fossil-fuel agenda—an agenda that poses as rational and scientific but is actually the opposite.[^2]

The **dozens of discrete attacks of the Biden Administration on the fossil fuel industry are not isolated incidents; they are all attempts to impose today's global anti-fossil-fuel agenda, which says that fossil fuel use must be essentially eliminated by the year 2050**.

At the beginning of his administration, **President Biden announced a US “whole of government” approach to “climate change”**—which in practice means **an overarching commitment to rapidly eliminate fossil fuels**. Every agency was told to figure out new ways to attack fossil fuels.[^3]
The Biden administration is systematically committed to attacking fossil fuels on 4 fronts, every one of which drives higher cost and lower reliability:

1. Fossil fuel investment
2. Fossil fuel production
3. Fossil fuel transport
4. Fossil fuel use, e.g. electricity generation

#### **The costs of punishing fossil fuel investment**

Fossil fuel investments are long-term commitments that require confidence in a payoff. Our government, often colluding with activists, incessantly discourages fossil fuel investments directly and by threatening the industry’s future.

**The Federal government has been a major driver of ESG anti-fossil-fuel climate policies**, with regulators pressuring financial institutions to declare their commitment to getting off fossil fuels. The SEC’s recent “climate disclosure rules” are taking the damage to the next level.[^4]

#### **The costs of punishing fossil fuel production**

**Punishing restrictions and onerous taxes specifically on fossil fuel production are common in developed countries**, suppressing supply from the freest nations on the globe.

One of the many punishments President Biden has inflicted on the supposedly-preferred fossil fuel industry was his early moratorium on issuing oil and gas leases on Federal lands. And **the Biden administration continues to delay and decline holding lease sales**.[^5]

#### **The costs of punishing fossil fuel transport**

One of the most effective ways of punishing the fossil fuel industry has been attacking critical transport infrastructure, including pipelines and export/import facilities, with delays, regulations, and lawsuits.

**Biden’s destruction of the Keystone XL pipeline inhibited Canada from bringing oil to market, which prevented Canada from using its vast oil deposits to their full potential**—meaning lower global supply and higher prices for oil.[^6]

Perhaps our most destructive way of singling out fossil fuel transport for punishment has been killing natural gas pipelines.

**We have a virtually limitless supply of gas and an incredible ability to ramp up production.**

**But we’re blocking pipeline after pipeline.**[^7]

#### **The costs of punishing fossil fuel use**

Our government's “whole of government” attack on fossil fuels seeks out every way it can to punish fossil fuel use.

**Perhaps the most destructive form of this is punishing reliable, fossil-fueled electricity generation and thereby destroying our grid.**

As a Californian, I am well aware of the costs of punishing fossil fuel electricity generation. Prematurely shutting down vital fossil fuel plants led to devastating statewide blackouts in 2020.[^8]

And **5 days after pledging to go all-EVs, Newsom told us there wasn't enough power to charge our EVs.**[^9]

![Flex Alert Conservation Actions](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77aa33ea-96a7-40cf-9eab-6e6c1cecb2a8_1600x900.jpeg)

**Nationally, we’re in an electricity crisis, with reliable power plants shutting down far faster than they are being built.**[^10]

And yet **the Biden EPA plans to make things much worse with 7 policies that gravely threaten 10-20% of our reliable capacity in the next 7 years.**[^11]

Every one of the hundreds of actions that the Biden Administration takes in the name of its “whole of government” anti-fossil-fuel agenda is harmful to American businesses, including small businesses, who have to struggle with higher energy costs and lower reliability.

#### **The lie that solar and wind can rapidly replace fossil fuels**

**The anti-fossil-fuel agenda pretends it's not harming us** by claiming, in contradiction to all evidence, that rapidly eliminating fossil fuels won't make energy more expensive and less reliable—because unreliable solar and wind can somehow replace fossil fuels.

**If solar and wind could actually replace fossil fuels, they wouldn't need massive government punishments of fossil fuels plus massive government preferences of their own—mandates, subsidies, and no penalty for unreliability.**[^12]

**If solar and wind could actually replace fossil fuels, China, which dominates the production of solar and wind components, wouldn't be using coal to produce these components**—and wouldn't have over 300 planned new coal plants designed to last over 40 years.[^13]

#### **How to fight back against the global anti-fossil-fuel agenda**

To counter the global anti-fossil-fuel agenda, American businesses need to use their powerful voices to do two things above all:

1. Refute the falsehood that fossil fuels are bringing about climate apocalypse
2. Offer a pro-freedom energy agenda

In my supplemental testimony, I have included a document, [“Countering the world's rigged conversation about energy and climate,”](https://alexepstein.substack.com/p/countering-the-worlds-rigged-conversation) that thoroughly exposes the faulty thinking methods and abuse of science behind the falsehood that fossil fuels are bringing about climate apocalypse.

In my supplemental testimony, I have also included a document, [“The Energy Freedom Platform,”](https://alexepstein.substack.com/p/the-energy-freedom-platform) that lays out a positive, pro-human, pro-science, pro-freedom energy agenda based on liberating our ability to empower the world using fossil fuels and to develop truly cost-effective alternatives.

My goal in testifying and answering your questions today, as well as in my work more broadly, is to give pro-freedom legislators, businesses, and other influencers the resources they need to fight for the energy freedom that all Americans and our businesses need to flourish.
