title: CO2 Emissions

description: The only practical way to lower global CO2 emissions is to
  encourage innovation that could make low-carbon energy cheap for everyone.
  Policies like the Green New Deal and the Biden Plan that would outlaw American
  fossil fuel use  won’t stop global CO2 emissions from rising--but they will
  ruin America.

### Quick summary

1. Many Democratic politicians claim that if America rapidly eliminates fossil fuel use, even at enormous cost, it will be worth it to lower CO2 levels and avoid a climate crisis. But the US causes less than 1/6 of global emissions—and falling.[^1]
2. The main reason global CO2 emissions are rising is because billions of people in the developing world are bringing themselves out of poverty by using fossil fuels to power factories, farms, vehicles, and appliances.[^2]
3. The developing world overwhelmingly uses fossil fuels because that is by far the lowest-cost way for them to get reliable energy. Unreliable solar and wind can’t come close. That’s why China and India have hundreds of new coal plants under construction.[^3]
4. The only way to lower CO2 emissions and benefit America is to promote innovation that makes low-carbon energy truly reliable and low-cost. Are China and India going to stop using fossil fuels so long as they are the lowest-cost option? They won’t and they shouldn’t.
5. America can lower emissions and energy costs by decriminalizing nuclear energy. Nuclear is actually the safest source of energy and the only way to provide reliable non-carbon electricity anywhere in the world. Yet politicians are overregulating it to death.[^4]
6. America can also lower emissions and energy costs by lifting irrational restrictions on natural gas, such as anti-fracking policies and pipeline opposition. Yet Joe Biden and most Democrats want to stop fracking and new pipelines.[^5] [^6]
7. The fossil fuel bans and “renewables only” policies supported by most Democratic politicians will make American energy incredibly unreliable and expensive. That won’t stop CO2 emissions from rising but it will ruin the American economy.

Of this total, 2,823 MMmt resulted from decreased use of coal and increased use of natural gas. 1,799 MMmt resulted from decreased use of coal and increased use of non-carbon generation sources.” - [U.S. Energy Information Administration - U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 2018](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/)

[^6]: In a [Democratic primary debate in March 2020](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/joe-biden-says-no-new-fracking-for-oil-and-gas) Joe Biden agreed to a radical “no new fracking” policy to attract Democratic voters. While most of the US unconventional oil and gas operations take place on private lands, even a federal policy banning new development would be a substantial hit on domestic energy production.

    Joe Biden’s [energy plan](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) also calls for a net-zero CO2 emissions economy wide by no later than 2050. His [climate plan](https://joebiden.com/climate/) also promises aggressive new methane emission limits. Effectively, this amounts to a ban and early retirement of coal, gas, and oil for electricity generation ([over 60%](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) of the current total), as there is no cost-effective technology available to capture CO2 from fuel combustion, even though Biden tried to [backpedal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2020/07/11/joe-biden-tries-to-clean-up-his-fracking-problem-in-pennsylvania/) on the direct attacks against fracking recently.
