**US Democrats are trying everything imaginable to lower oil/gasoline prices except the thing that would actually work**: STOP THREATENING THE EXISTENCE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY. **Instead of acknowledging their key role in increasing oil prices, Dems are engaging in epic denial tactics.**

- ​​For 15+ years Democratic **politicians**, including Joe Biden, **have relentlessly attacked oil investment, oil production, and oil transport**—leading to **higher prices and lower security**.
    Instead of taking credit for their "success," they are **denying that they are anti-fossil fuels!**[^1]

- **The "business decisions" denial tactic**
    For 15+ years Democratic politicians have **pushed everything they can to threaten new oil production: net-zero, ESG, proposed bans**, etc.
    Now they are **blaming companies for "business decisions" to refrain from threatened oil production!**[^2]

- **The "windfall profits" denial tactic**
    For 15+ years Democratic politicians have done **everything they can to make new oil production unprofitable**—leading to less investment.
    Now they are condemning companies for **not investing enough "windfall profits"!**[^3]

- **The “9000 leases” denial tactic**
    For 15+ years Dem politicians have driven up oil prices by delaying/destroying countless **economically viable oil projects.**
    To deny responsibility they are **attacking companies for not developing 9000 leases judged to be economically nonviable.**[^4]

- **The "price gouging" denial tactic**
    For 15+ years Democratic politicians have driven up oil prices by **attacking oil investment, oil production, and oil transport.**
    To deny responsibility they are calling for **yet another worthless "price gouging" investigation.**[^5]

- **The energy crisis is simple.**
    Politicians around the world, including US Dems, have **restricted fossil fuel investment/production/transport on the false promise of replacement by unreliable solar/wind.**
    The result: **higher prices and lower security.** 
    Dems, **please stop the denial.**
